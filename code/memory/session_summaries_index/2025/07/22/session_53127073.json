(originally Tesla Motors ) begins in 2003, with two American entrepreneurs: Marc Tarpenning and Martin Eberhard . Eberhard had a Masters in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois, while Tarpenning had a Bachelors in Computer Sciences. Eberhards newly discovered passion for sports cars led them to invest in a boutique-level EV company named AC Propulsion, and the two coopted PayPal founder Elon Musk into the business in 2001. Thus, Tesla Motors , the company with the goal of developing robust, beautiful and zero emission electric vehicles was born.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The founders were influenced to start the company after General Motors recalled all its EV1 electric cars in 2003 and then destroyed them, [ 6 ] and seeing the higher fuel efficiency of battery-electric cars as an opportunity to break the usual correlation between high performance and low fuel economy in automobiles . [ 7 ] The AC Propulsion tzero also inspired the company\\'s first vehicle, the Roadster . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Eberhard said he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\". [ 10 ] Ian Wright was the third employee, joining a few months later. [ 3 ] The three went looking for venture capital (VC) funding in January 2004 [ 3 ] and connected with Elon Musk , who contributed US$6.5 million of the initial ( Series A ) US$7.5 million [ 11 ] round of investment in February 2004 and became chairman of the board of directors.
