    "original_query": "Project Overview:Generate a full, multi-page website for a cutting-edge rocket launching startup named \"Ignis Aeris\" (Latin for \"Fire of the Air\"). The website needs to evoke a sense of power, precision, and the boundless ambition of space exploration. It should be a visually stunning, immersive experience.Core Aesthetic:Dominant Theme: Dark, sophisticated, and modern. Think deep space, night launches, and the sleek lines of aerospace engineering.Color Palette: Primarily charcoal grays, deep blues (like a night sky), black, with minimalist accents of neon or electric blues/purples (for energy, light trails, or interactive elements) and subtle, warm amber/orange (representing rocket exhaust, energy, or sunrises from orbit). Avoid bright, primary colors.Typography: Clean, sans-serif fonts. Headings should be bold and impactful, body text highly readable. Consider a slightly futuristic, technical feel without being overtly sci-fi.Mood: Aspirational, powerful, reliable, innovative, exclusive.Image Sourcing:STRICTLY PICSUM.PHOTOS ONLY. No external images, no custom uploads.Utilize a variety of Picsum images: landscapes (especially high-altitude or dramatic), abstract cityscapes at night, technological close-ups (if available and fitting), and anything that can be interpreted as space, a launchpad, or a futuristic environment.Crucial: Images must be seamlessly integrated and never appear as placeholders. They should feel like they were custom-selected for each section. Use the Picsum image IDs and dimensions strategically (e.g., https://picsum.photos/id/XXX/WIDTH/HEIGHT). Overlap, crop, and layer images as needed.Required Elements & Functionality (Detailed for each page):GENERAL WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS:Responsiveness: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile.Animations: Extensive, subtle, and impactful animations throughout.Scroll Animations: Elements fading in, sliding up/down/sideways, subtle parallax effects on background images.Hover Animations: Every clickable element (buttons, menu items, images, cards) must have a distinct, elegant hover effect. (e.g., subtle glow, slight scale, border change, text color shift).Loading Animations: A sleek, minimal pre-loader (e.g., a constellation forming, a rocket outline appearing) before the main content loads.No Empty States: Every section, every card, every pixel must have content and purpose. No placeholder text like \"Lorem Ipsum\" or \"Coming Soon.\"Accessibility: Basic accessibility considerations (e.g., alt tags for images, logical tab order).Performance: Optimized for fast loading.PAGE 1: HOME PAGE (ignisaeris.com)Header/Hero Section:Background: Large, dramatic Picsum image (e.g., a dark, atmospheric landscape or abstract night sky) with a subtle, slow parallax scroll effect. Overlay with a dark, semi-transparent gradient.Logo: Top left, sleek \"Ignis Aeris\" logo (design the logo yourself based on the aesthetic, e.g., stylized rocket plume or constellation).Navigation: Top right, elegant horizontal menu bar.Items: HOME, MISSIONS, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGY, ABOUT US, CONTACT.Hover Effect: Each item glows subtly or has an underline animation that expands from the center.Main Headline: Large, bold, impactful. E.g., \"LAUNCHING TOMORROW'S AMBITION, TODAY.\" or \"IGNITING THE FUTURE OF ORBITAL ACCESS.\"Sub-headline: Briefly explain the core service. E.g., \"Reliable, high-frequency access to low-Earth orbit and beyond.\"Call-to-Action (CTA) Button: Prominent, animated. E.g., \"BEGIN YOUR MISSION\" or \"EXPLORE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES.\"Hover Effect: Button border glows, background fills with accent color, or text color inverts.Click Effect: Subtle ripple or pulse.\"Our Vision\" Section:Split layout: One side with a compelling Picsum image (e.g., something abstractly futuristic or a vast landscape), the other with a concise paragraph explaining the company's vision and goals.Subtle scroll animation for content.\"Capabilities\" / \"Our Rockets\" Section:Use a grid or carousel layout to showcase 3-4 \"rocket series\" or \"launch vehicles.\"Each item:Title (e.g., \"Ares-I Series,\" \"Luna-X Heavy Lift\").Brief description (1-2 sentences).Associated Picsum image (e.g., a dark, imposing structure or a detailed technical shot that hints at a rocket).\"Learn More\" button.Hover Effect: Entire card slightly scales up, a border appears, or a faint glow emanates.Implement subtle horizontal or fade-in scroll animations for the cards.\"Why Choose Ignis Aeris?\" Section:Bullet points or icon-based features (e.g., \"Reliability,\" \"Innovation,\" \"Cost-Efficiency,\" \"Customer Focus\").Each point should have a small, relevant icon (design these yourself, minimal, vector-like).Fade-in animation for each point as it scrolls into view.\"Latest News/Updates\" (Minimalist):A small, elegant section displaying the two most recent \"updates\" or \"mission highlights.\"Each item: short title, date, very brief snippet.Link to a dedicated \"News\" or \"Updates\" page (not required to be built for this prompt, just a placeholder link).Footer:Clean and structured.Company logo.Quick links (e.g., Privacy Policy, Terms of Service - no content needed, just links).Social media icons (e.g., X/Twitter, LinkedIn - design minimal, glowing on hover).Copyright information.Subtle background pattern or texture.PAGE 2: MISSIONS (ignisaeris.com/missions)Hero Section: Smaller, focused headline: \"OUR JOURNEY TO THE STARS.\" Sub-headline: \"Explore past achievements and upcoming endeavors.\"Background: A dramatic Picsum image of Earth from space or a distant nebula.\"Past Missions\" Section:Grid of 3-4 prominent past missions.Each Mission Card:Mission Name (e.g., \"Pathfinder-01,\" \"Skyhook Ascent\").Date.Mission Objective (1 line).Result (e.g., \"Successful Deployment,\" \"Orbital Insertion\").Crucial: A unique Picsum image for each mission card, subtly representing its objective or outcome (e.g., a satellite-like object, an abstract light trail, a view of Earth).\"View Details\" button.Hover Effect: Card lifts slightly, background subtly changes tint, or a border animates around it.Implement an option to filter missions by year or type (e.g., \"Commercial,\" \"Scientific\"). No actual filtering functionality needed, just the UI elements.\"Upcoming Launches\" Section:List format or timeline visualization.For each upcoming launch:Mission Name.Target Launch Date (e.g., \"Q4 2024,\" \"Early 2025\").Payload/Client (e.g., \"Orbital Data Relay,\" \"Planetary Probe\").A small, representative Picsum image for the mission.\"Request Details\" button.Animation: Elements slide in or fade in as they become visible.\"Mission Capabilities\" Section:Brief overview of what kinds of missions Ignis Aeris supports (e.g., LEO, MEO, GEO, interplanetary, dedicated, rideshare).Visually represent with 3-4 large icons (design yourself, modern, abstract) and short descriptions.Hover Effect: Icons glow or slightly enlarge.PAGE 3: SERVICES (ignisaeris.com/services)Hero Section: \"BESPOKE ORBITAL SOLUTIONS.\" Sub-headline: \"Tailored launch services for every requirement.\"Background: A Picsum image hinting at precision, data, or complex systems.\"Our Service Offerings\" Section:Cards for 3-4 key service categories (e.g., \"Dedicated Launches,\" \"Rideshare Opportunities,\" \"In-Orbit Servicing,\" \"Mission Integration\").Each card:Service Title.Detailed paragraph explaining the service.Relevant Picsum image (e.g., abstract patterns, interconnected lines, a distant object).\"Inquire Now\" button.Hover Effect: Card shadow deepens, a subtle border appears, or a small icon inside animates.\"The Launch Process\" Section:A visual, step-by-step timeline or infographic (e.g., \"Consultation -> Integration -> Launch -> Post-Launch Support\").Use minimal icons for each step (design yourself).Animation: Steps light up or slide into view sequentially as the user scrolls down.\"Client Focus\" Section:A single, impactful paragraph emphasizing customer support and partnership.A strong, positive Picsum image that feels collaborative or aspirational.PAGE 4: TECHNOLOGY (ignisaeris.com/technology)Hero Section: \"INNOVATION DRIVING ACCESS.\" Sub-headline: \"The cutting edge of aerospace engineering.\"Background: A highly detailed, almost abstract Picsum image focusing on textures, machinery, or complex structures.\"Propulsion Systems\" Section:Split layout.

These should be framed elegantly (e.g., circular, subtly glowing border on hover).Hover Effect: Profile images subtly zoom in or a nameplate appears.\"Our Values\" Section:3-5 core values (e.g., \"Integrity,\" \"Excellence,\" \"Safety,\" \"Innovation\").Each value with a short description and a small, minimal icon (design yourself).Animation: Values fade in sequentially.\"Careers\" Section:A concise statement inviting talent.A \"View Openings\" button (no page needed).PAGE 6: CONTACT (ignisaeris.com/contact)Hero Section: \"CONNECT WITH US.\" Sub-headline: \"Let's launch your vision together.\"Background: A Picsum image that feels professional yet aspirational, perhaps a blurred cityscape or a technological interior.Contact Form:Prominent, clean, dark-themed form.Fields: Name, Email, Company (optional), Subject, Message.Submit Button: Animated on hover, similar to the main CTA.Subtle input field animations (e.g., border lights up on focus).Contact Information Sidebar:Address (e.g., \"Ignis Aeris HQ, Launch Complex 1, Cape Nebula, Orbital Province\").Phone number.Email address (clickable).Social Media Icons (same as footer, animated).Map Integration (Conceptual):A placeholder for a map (e.g., a dark, abstract image that looks like a map area, with a pinpoint icon). No actual Google Maps integration needed, just the visual representation.\"Reach Out\" CTA: A final, strong call to action inviting inquiries.MANDATORY HINTS FOR THE AGENT:Think \"Subtle Power\": Animations should be smooth, not jarring. Design elements should convey strength and precision.Storytelling Through Images: Every Picsum image should tell a part of the Ignis Aeris story. Do not just drop random images. Consider the mood and implication of each image.Layering and Depth: Utilize CSS layering, shadows, and subtle gradients to create depth and sophistication.Attention to Detail: Small details like custom scrollbars (if possible), consistent iconography, and perfect alignment will elevate the site.Performance First: Keep the code lean and efficient. Heavy animations should not compromise load times.This prompt is designed to push the agent to its limits, requiring not just static page generation but deep integration of aesthetic, dynamic elements, and a narrative driven by limited image resources. Good luck, agent!",
