For other uses, see President of the United States (disambiguation) . The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States , [ 1 ] indirectly elected to a four-year term via the Electoral College . [ 2 ] Under the U.S. Constitution , the officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces . [ 3 ] The White House , official residence of the president of the United States The first president, George Washington , won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. [ 4 ] The incumbent president is Donald Trump , who assumed office on January 20, 2025 . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 47 presidencies; the discrepancy arises from two individuals elected to nonconsecutive terms: Grover Cleveland is counted as both the 22nd and 24th president, while Trump is counted as both the 45th and 47th president. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The presidency of William Henry Harrison , who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history. [ 9 ] Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. [ 10 ] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once. [ 11 ] Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor , Warren G. Harding , and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated ( Abraham Lincoln , James A. Garfield , William McKinley , and John F. Kennedy ), and one resigned ( Richard Nixon , facing impeachment and removal from office). [ 12 ] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, setting the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with a new, distinct administration. [ 13 ] Throughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties . The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson . [ 14 ] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president who never affiliated with a political party.

Franklin Roosevelt was the only president elected for more than two terms. Since 1789 and the election of George Washington, America\\'s first president, 45 individuals have served as the chief executive of the United States ( Grover Cleveland was elected for two nonconsecutive terms, so he served as the 22nd and 24th president). The unamended Constitution mandated that a president would serve for four years. Originally, it did not state if there was to be a limit on the number of terms to which they could be elected. However, President Washington set a precedent of only serving two terms which was followed until November 5, 1940, when Franklin Roosevelt was elected for a third term. He would go on to win a fourth before dying in office. The 22nd Amendment was passed soon afterward that would limit presidents to only serving two terms or 10 years . Below is a list of presidents and vice presidents and their parties , plus links to their biographies and their terms in office.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The presidency of William Henry Harrison , who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history. [ 9 ] Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. [ 10 ] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once. [ 11 ] Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor , Warren G. Harding , and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated ( Abraham Lincoln , James A.

[ 12 ] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, setting the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with a new, distinct administration. [ 13 ] Throughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties . The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson . [ 14 ] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president who never affiliated with a political party.

Franklin Roosevelt was the only president elected for more than two terms. Since 1789 and the election of George Washington, America\\'s first president, 45 individuals have served as the chief executive of the United States ( Grover Cleveland was elected for two nonconsecutive terms, so he served as the 22nd and 24th president). The unamended Constitution mandated that a president would serve for four years. Originally, it did not state if there was to be a limit on the number of terms to which they could be elected. However, President Washington set a precedent of only serving two terms which was followed until November 5, 1940, when Franklin Roosevelt was elected for a third term. He would go on to win a fourth before dying in office. The 22nd Amendment was passed soon afterward that would limit presidents to only serving two terms or 10 years . Below is a list of presidents and vice presidents and their parties , plus links to their biographies and their terms in office.
