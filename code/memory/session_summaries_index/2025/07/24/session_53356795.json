The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,394 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://autotorque.in/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-features-and-performance/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.carwale.com/mahindra-cars/xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://whatinsider.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

The Harman Kardon audio system, a supplier to luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, delivers high-fidelity sound. Features like a 360-degree camera, auto headlamps and wipers, and wireless smartphone charging contribute to convenience and a premium feel.\n\nBeyond aesthetics and comfort, the XUV 3XO incorporates advanced technology to enhance safety and driving experience. All models come standard with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), including Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) with pedestrian and cyclist detection, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keeping Assist, Traffic Sign Recognition, and Forward Collision Warning. Adaptive Cruise Control and Smart Pilot Assist enable Level 2 semi-autonomous driving, maintaining speed and distance to the car ahead and providing active lane keeping assistance on highways.\n\nThe XUV 3XO's competitive pricing makes its luxury features accessible to a broader range of customers. The top-spec AX7L variant offers a panoramic sunroof, dual 10.25-inch digital displays, 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, and a Harman Kardon stereo system at a price point that undercuts many of its rivals. Mahindra also offers a seven-year warranty, providing peace of mind and underscoring its commitment to quality. It competes with the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, MG ZS, and Chery Tiggo 4.\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO offers a compelling value proposition, potential drawbacks include a smaller boot space (295 liters) compared to some competitors, which could be a concern for buyers prioritizing cargo capacity. Some reviewers have also noted that the steering feel can be disconnected, which may detract from the driving experience. Mahindra's after-sales service quality has been a concern in the past, although the company has been working to improve it. The polarizing exterior design may not appeal to everyone.\n\nIn summary, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is a feature-packed compact SUV that aims to deliver a premium experience at an affordable price. Its combination of stylish design, luxurious interior appointments, advanced technology, and competitive pricing makes it a compelling option in the crowded compact SUV segment. Potential buyers should weigh the benefits against the drawbacks and consider their individual needs and preferences before making a decision.",

The new name is just the starting point of a very comprehensive upgrade. Updated on May 02, 2024 05:35:55 PM 87,394 Views Follow us on The XUV 3XO's styling is big on flash The diamond-shaped detailing on the lights and grille are a nice touch. The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm. Mahindra XUV 3XO Price, Mileage, Specifications, Features and Variants Brand Mahindra Model Name XUV 3XO Mahindra XUV 3XO Price 9.06 - 18.39 lakh Mahindra XUV 3XO Range/Mileage Petrol : 17.96 - 20.1kpl | Diesel : 20.6 - 21.2kpl Mahindra XUV 3XO Specifications SUV | 5 doors | 5 seats View All Specs Mahindra XUV 3XO Features LED headlight | 10.25-inch Touchscreen display | 6 airbags View All Features Mahindra XUV 3XO Variants MX1 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M 1.2 Petrol MT | REVX M (O) 1.2 Petrol MT View All Variants In its basic shape though, the 3XO is no different than the XUV300. The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

Mahindra XUV 3XO Pros A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai Fantastic petrol & diesel engine line-up; they offer fast performance & good driveability Finally gets a smooth torque converter automatic with the turbo-petrol engines Wide variant spread ensures there's something for everyone A compliant ride with sorted road manners 5-star NCAP rating & kit. Level 2 ADAS, 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more Loaded to the gills with equipment (360-degree camera, big sunroof, drive modes, Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone connectivity, auto headlamps & wipers etc.) Mahindra XUV 3XO Cons The new edgy & outlandish design may not be to everyone's liking. Some love it, some don't. It is very polarizing Top-end variants are expensive. Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected 295-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks that have a larger boot No proper diesel automatic option, just a jerky AMT which has no place in a premium crossover Light & disconnected steering is the biggest drawback in a competent handling package Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss.

Pros Excellent exterior design Cheap price tag Well-equipped Cons Slightly lacking in safety equipment Disconnected steering feel Dated-looking dashboard Car specs 82 kW + 200 Nm $23,990 drive away 6.5L/100km Unrated Want a great rate on your next car? Enquire now The Small SUV is one of the most popular car segments in Australia, and Indian manufacturer, Mahindra, are looking to establish themselves at the budget end of a market. However, this is currently the territory of the Chery Tiggo 4. The Tiggo 4 and the pre-facelift Tiggo 4 Pro offers a comfortable, well-equipped package with a very competitive price tag. The Mahindra XUV 3XO is not, in fact, C-3POs new set of wheels as its name would suggest, but it is the Indian-marques latest offering with budget and value conscious customers in mind, lining up the Tiggo 4 squarely in its crosshair. However, the small SUV space is as competitive as it is abundant, and the 3XO will not only go toe-to-toe with the Tiggo 4, but also its rivals including the likes of the MG ZS, GWM Haval Jolion and Hyundai Venue. But can the new Mahindra find its feet in its segment? And can it take on the Tiggo 4? Value for Money How much does the 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO cost? In order to take the fight to the Tiggo 4 and other value offerings in the small SUV segment, Mahindra had to get the price of the XUV 3XO right. They did. With prices starting from $23,990 drive away for the entry-level AX5L trim level, The Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives as one of the most competitively priced offerings in the segment. Its price tag matches that of the entry-level Tiggo 4 to the dollar, and its the same story when you go one level up to the AX7L model, priced at $26,990 drive away. Until August 31st, 2025, both 3XO trim levels will be discounted by $500 for introductory pricing, temporarily undercutting the Tiggo-4 as a result. Not only is the Mahindra XUV 3XO the joint cheapest small SUVs, its now also one of the cheapest new cars in Australia. 2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Pricing: AX5L: $23,990 drive away AX7L: $26,990 drive away Options Metallic Paint (on all colours except white): $495 Are you interested in a Mahindra XUV 3XO and looking for the best price? Find a Deal! Exterior Styling Diamonds are Mahindra Despite wrapping a platform thats over a decade old, the Mahindra XUV 3XO arrives with a trendy, contemporary exterior design. It stands out in Mahindras Australian range as the most modern-looking vehicle on offer and sets itself apart in what is becoming an increasingly uniform segment. The styling is angular and striking, sporting a diamond theme most evident in the headlight design, the accents placed on the exterior trim including on the tail lights, roof rails and rear bumper, and the diamond cut alloy wheels. Additional touches such as the rear light bar and the two tone roof featured on some specs further aid in its effectiveness. Somehow, the proportions resulting from the short wheelbase and little overhang have been supremely managed too, with the 3XO appearing tightly pa\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6868788cf479f4ed60135708_hero.webp', 'alt_text': '2026 Mahindra XUV 3XO Review', 'class': 'review-hero-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://cdn.carsauce.com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6847a810de906801142b7037_jack-mackenzie-1.webp', 'alt_text': 'Jack MacKenzie', 'class': 'blogpost2_author-image', 'loading': 'eager', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://autotorque.in/mahindra-xuv-3xo-review-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-features-and-performance/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.carwale.com/mahindra-cars/xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://whatinsider.com/mahindra-xuv-3xo/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

            "summary": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO aims to deliver premium features at a competitive price point, with luxury features like dual 10.25-inch displays, panoramic sunroof, Harman Kardon audio, and ADAS. Interior quality is reportedly comparable to Hyundai. It challenges the compact SUV segment with a blend of modern design and features.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The Mahindra XUV 3XO represents a significant upgrade in the compact SUV segment, targeting value-conscious customers who seek a premium experience. Its exterior design is a departure from its predecessor, the XUV300, with a more modern and eye-catching aesthetic. The front fascia features vertically oriented headlights flanked by C-shaped DRLs, visually connecting it to the larger XUV700. Diamond-shaped detailing is evident in the lights and grille, adding a touch of sophistication. The new front bumper and contoured bonnet contribute to a more voluminous appearance. The available 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, the largest in the segment, enhance the vehicle's sporty appeal.\n\nInside, the XUV 3XO aims to elevate the cabin experience with premium features and materials. Reviews suggest interior quality comparable to Hyundai, a brand known for its well-appointed interiors. The dual 10.25-inch digital displays create a modern and immersive environment, with one serving as the infotainment screen and the other as the instrument cluster. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity provide seamless smartphone integration. Some models offer a panoramic sunroof, further enhancing the sense of spaciousness and luxury. The Harman Kardon audio system, a supplier to luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, delivers high-fidelity sound. Features like a 360-degree camera, auto headlamps and wipers, and wireless smartphone charging contribute to convenience and a premium feel.\n\nBeyond aesthetics and comfort, the XUV 3XO incorporates advanced technology to enhance safety and driving experience. All models come standard with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), including Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) with pedestrian and cyclist detection, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keeping Assist, Traffic Sign Recognition, and Forward Collision Warning. Adaptive Cruise Control and Smart Pilot Assist enable Level 2 semi-autonomous driving, maintaining speed and distance to the car ahead and providing active lane keeping assistance on highways.\n\nThe XUV 3XO's competitive pricing makes its luxury features accessible to a broader range of customers. The top-spec AX7L variant offers a panoramic sunroof, dual 10.25-inch digital displays, 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, and a Harman Kardon stereo system at a price point that undercuts many of its rivals. Mahindra also offers a seven-year warranty, providing peace of mind and underscoring its commitment to quality. It competes with the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue, MG ZS, and Chery Tiggo 4.\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO offers a compelling value proposition, potential drawbacks include a smaller boot space (295 liters) compared to some competitors, which could be a concern for buyers prioritizing cargo capacity. Some reviewers have also noted that the steering feel can be disconnected, which may detract from the driving experience. Mahindra's after-sales service quality has been a concern in the past, although the company has been working to improve it. The polarizing exterior design may not appeal to everyone.\n\nIn summary, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is a feature-packed compact SUV that aims to deliver a premium experience at an affordable price. Its combination of stylish design, luxurious interior appointments, advanced technology, and competitive pricing makes it a compelling option in the crowded compact SUV segment. Potential buyers should weigh the benefits against the drawbacks and consider their individual needs and preferences before making a decision.",
