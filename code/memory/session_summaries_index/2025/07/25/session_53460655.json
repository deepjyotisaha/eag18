Now, your task is to add all the required files into a single folder, and then create a zip file called tictactoe.zip. If your file write fails due to any reason, use an alternative way to create that zip file. Report what files were added inside the output. Make sure to create the zip file and add the files to it, instead of assuming that it is already there.",
