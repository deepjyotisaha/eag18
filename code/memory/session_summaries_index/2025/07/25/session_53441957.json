Share this item with your network: By Alexander S. Gillis, Technical Writer and Editor Published: 17 Jul 2024 Electric vehicles are becoming more common across the United States, especially as states look toward banning the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035. States that plan to phase out gas-powered vehicle sales include California, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Electric vehicle sales are not just growing in the U.S. market; many domestic and foreign markets are also seeing growth in the EV industry. Current EV market trends EV sales are expected to continue growing in 2024, with the largest and most significant global markets for EVs being in China, the U.S. and Europe. According to research published in June 2024 by Rho Motion, more than 5 million EVs were bought globally from January to May -- a 20% increase compared to the same period in 2023. However, EV sales in the U.S. and Europe are beginning to slow. This could be due to several factors, such as tariffs on foreign EVs, lacking EV charging infrastructure, price, range anxiety and a challenging economy in general for both regions. A forecast published at the end of 2023 by Cox Automotive predicted EVs will still account for 10% of total vehicle sales in 2024 in the U.S. While these markets are still growing, their overall growth is expanding at a slower rate than China's. The Chinese EV market in 2024, as stated by Rho Motion, has grown 31% in the same January-May period compared to 2023. The increased number of sales in China is also due to a number of different factors, such as many Chinese EV manufacturers being state-backed. Other factors, such as a heavier automated manufacturing process and lower wages, mean that Chinese consumers have access to EVs at substantially lower prices. Here are some other trends happening in the EV market in 2024. Import tariffs Both the U.S. and EU are applying tariffs to foreign -- notably Chinese -- EVs to defend their own market. For example, in 2024, Europe applied an increased tariff on Chinese EVs up to 38.1%. The U.S. enacted a 100% tariff rate on Chinese EVs , quadrupling the previous 25% tariff. Imported EVs also do not qualify for federal tax credits. Many electric vehicle companies on market As of October 2023, Tesla accounted for more than half the EV market share in the U.S., according to MarketWatch statistics . Chevrolet followed next with 5.9% and then Ford with 5.8%, Hyundai at 4.8% and Rivian at 3.7% -- 23.5% were labeled as Other. Globally, the top-selling brands are Tesla, BYD, Geely-Volvo, SAIC and Volkswagen Group, as reported by InsideEVs. Increased competition Some of the largest manufacturers in the EV space include the following: BYD. Chevrolet. Ford. Geely-Volvo. Hyundai. Rivian. SAIC. Tesla. Volkswagen Group. Other popular EV manufacturers include Lucid, Polestar and VinFast. A combination of factors, such as increased competition, unrealistic expectations, slowing markets and rushed-to-market vehicles, have caused the collapse of some EV manufacturers. For example, in June 2024, EV manufacturer Fisker filed for bankruptcy. Days before, Fisker recalled more than 6,000 Ocean SUVs due t\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/gillis_alex.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Alexander S.

This article provides a detailed look at the key factors driving these changes, offering insights into how the electric vehicle landscape has evolved and what it means for the future of the automotive industry. Electric Vehicles Michael Nowosielski December 12, 2024 Key Takeaways Electric vehicles (EVs) are projected to account for 16.5% of the global automotive market in 2024, with a notable increase in sales driven by consumer preferences and government incentives. Significant advancements in EV technology, particularly in battery efficiency and charging infrastructure, are enhancing the accessibility and appeal of electric vehicles to a broader demographic. The expansion of affordable EV models, coupled with ongoing government tax credits, is critical to increasing market adoption and addressing consumer concerns related to cost and range anxiety. Surge in EV Sales The year 2024 has been a landmark for electric vehicle sales, with EVs projected to represent 16.5% of the global automobile market. This significant increase is part of a continuing trend, with nearly 1.9 million EVs expected to be sold in the United States alone and global sales reaching 14 million electric cars sold. The rise of electric and hybrid vehicles is set to account for almost 24% of total vehicle sales this year, marking a substantial shift in the automotive industry. The first quarter of 2024 has already seen a 25% increase in electric car sales compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a strong and sustained growth trajectory. This surge is not just a fleeting trend but a clear indication of the growing consumer preference for electric mobility and the increasing availability of diverse electric car models. Leading Markets for EV Sales In 2023, the global market for electric vehicles was heavily concentrated in three main regions: China, which dominated the market with 60% of global electric vehicle sales Europe the United States, which achieved a market share of 7.9% for fully electric vehicles by the third quarter of 2023 These three regions accounted for 95% of global EV sales, showcasing their leadership and significant market growth in the industry. Emerging markets like Thailand and Brazil are rapidly catching up, driven by local incentives and the increasing availability of affordable electric car models. Southeast Asia is becoming a key player, with notable sales increases in countries such as Vietnam and Thailand. In March 2024, new energy vehicle sales in China reached 40% of overall car sales, underscoring the rapid market growth in these regions. Impact of Government Policies on EV Sales Government policies have played a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles across the globe. In India, EV registrations have surged, driven by government incentives and a growing local manufacturing presence. Similarly, in Latin America, programs like Brazils Green Mobility Programme have established a robust framework for electric vehicle development and adoption. These targeted government policies and incentives have', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.webuyanycarusa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ev-Market-2-1.png', 'alt_text': 'Various prices surrounding a car image', 'width': '900', 'height': '473', 'class': 'wp-image-1114', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.webuyanycarusa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bram-van-oost-4xM5cytsdMo-unsplash-1024x683.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Interior car shot showing off technology.', 'width': '1024', 'height': '683', 'class': 'wp-image-1032', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.webuyanycarusa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/EV-Charging-station-1024x533.png', 'alt_text': 'A full bank of electric vehicle charging stations.', 'width': '1024', 'height': '533', 'class': 'wp-image-1108', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.globalsources.com/knowledge/the-2024-outlook-for-electric-vehicles-top-10-trends-to-watch/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://automotivequest.com/electric-vehicle-trends-in-2024/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://smaev.com/news/11493/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Significant advancements in EV technology, particularly in battery efficiency and charging infrastructure, are enhancing the accessibility and appeal of electric vehicles to a broader demographic. The expansion of affordable EV models, coupled with ongoing government tax credits, is critical to increasing market adoption and addressing consumer concerns related to cost and range anxiety. Surge in EV Sales The year 2024 has been a landmark for electric vehicle sales, with EVs projected to represent 16.5% of the global automobile market. This significant increase is part of a continuing trend, with nearly 1.9 million EVs expected to be sold in the United States alone and global sales reaching 14 million electric cars sold. The rise of electric and hybrid vehicles is set to account for almost 24% of total vehicle sales this year, marking a substantial shift in the automotive industry. The first quarter of 2024 has already seen a 25% increase in electric car sales compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a strong and sustained growth trajectory.
