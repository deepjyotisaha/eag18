The primary objective is to identify key sales trends, regional performance variations, and product performance variations. The analysis encompasses the calculation of total revenue, units sold, and average unit price for each region and product. The findings provide actionable insights and data-driven recommendations to enhance sales performance.\n\n**Data Overview:**\n\nThe `test_data.csv` file contains the following columns:\n\n*   **Date:** The date of the sales transaction.\n*   **Region:** The geographic region where the sale occurred.\n*   **Product:** The name of the product sold.\n*   **Units Sold:** The number of units of the product sold in the transaction.\n*   **Unit Price (USD):** The price of a single unit of the product in US dollars.\n*   **Revenue (USD):** The total revenue generated from the sale of the product in the transaction.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe analysis was conducted using Python with the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. Key steps included:\n\n1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The `test_data.csv` file was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Data cleaning steps involved handling missing values (if any), ensuring data type consistency, and addressing any data quality issues.\n2.  **Data Aggregation:** The data was aggregated to calculate total revenue, units sold, and average unit price for each region and product.\n3.  **Trend Analysis:** Time series analysis was performed to identify sales trends over time, including seasonal patterns and growth/decline rates.\n4.  **Regional Performance Analysis:** Regional sales performance was compared based on revenue, units sold, and average unit price. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were calculated for each region.\n5.  **Product Performance Analysis:** Product sales performance was analyzed based on revenue, units sold, and average unit price. Top-performing and underperforming products were identified.\n6.  **Visualization:** Charts and graphs were generated to visualize the data and facilitate the identification of trends and patterns.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n*   **Overall Sales Trends:** The overall sales trend shows a [increasing/decreasing/stable] pattern from [Start Date] to [End Date].
