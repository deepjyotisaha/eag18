Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque.

Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely!
