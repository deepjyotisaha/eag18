The application must have a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and include interactive features such as dynamic content updates, form validation, and user interface enhancements. Start by defining the basic HTML structure with placeholders for different sections (header, navigation, main content, footer). Create a CSS stylesheet to define the visual theme, layout, and responsive behavior of the application. Implement JavaScript code to handle user interactions, data manipulation, and dynamic content updates. Ensure the code is well-structured, commented, and follows best practices for web development. Use modern web development techniques like CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout and ES6+ for JavaScript. The application should have a clean and professional design with a focus on usability and accessibility. Output all code to index.html, style.css, script.js files. Leave placeholders for future updates",
