By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/trends-in-electric-car-markets-2', 'content': \"Trends in electric car markets Global EV Outlook 2025 Analysis - IEA IEA Close Search Search About News Events Programmes Help centre IEA Skip navigation Search Energy system Chevron down Explore the energy system by fuel, technology or sector Fossil Fuels Renewables Electricity Low-Emissions Fuels Transport Industry Buildings Energy Efficiency and Demand Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Decarbonisation Enablers Buildings Energy Efficiency and Demand Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Decarbonisation Enablers Explore all Topics Chevron down Understand the biggest energy challenges Energy Security Artificial Intelligence Critical Minerals Access and Affordability Energy Innovation Investment Climate Change COP28: Tracking the Energy Outcomes Net Zero Emissions Russia's War on Ukraine Climate Change COP28: Tracking the Energy Outcomes Net Zero Emissions Russia's War on Ukraine Energy and Gender Energy and Water Fossil Fuel Subsidies Saving Energy Global Energy Crisis The IEA's 50th Anniversary All topics Countries Chevron down Explore the energy system by country or region Member countries Australia Austria Belgium Canada Czechia Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Ireland Italy Japan Korea Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Mexico New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Slovak Republic Spain Sweden Switzerland The Netherlands Trkiye United Kingdom United States Accession countries Chile Colombia Costa Rica Israel Association countries Argentina Brazil China Egypt India Indonesia Kenya Morocco Senegal Singapore South Africa Thailand Ukraine All Countries and Regions Data Chevron down Use, download and buy global energy data Data explorers Understand and manipulate data with easy to use explorers and trackers Data explorers Data sets Free and paid data sets from across the energy system available for download Data sets Policies database Past, existing or planned government policies and measures Policies database Chart Library Access every chart published across all IEA reports and analysis Chart Explore data Reports Chevron down Read the latest analysis from the IEA Oil Market Report - July 2025 Fuel report  July 2025 Energy and AI Flagship report  April 2025 Energy Technology Perspectives 2024 Flagship report  October 2024 World Energy Outlook 2024 Flagship report  October 2024 All reports Search Bag 1 User Profile Search Sign In Flyout close You are connecting via IP recognition from .

Overview Toggle What Are the Top Electric Vehicle Brands Globally? What were the top Electric Car Brands in 2022 and 2021? What are the Leading Electric Vehicle Models? What are the future projections for the EV Industry? What Are the Top Electric Vehicle Brands Globally? Tesla : Held the largest global EV market share in 2023 at 19.9% . However, its expected to lose its leading position to BYD in 2024 . BYD : The Chinese automaker closely followed Tesla in 2023 with a 17.1% market share. In Q4 2023, BYD outsold Tesla by delivering 526,000 units compared to Teslas 485,000 units. Analysts predict BYD will overtake Tesla in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales by the end of 2024. Other Notable Brands: GAC Aion : 5.2% market share. SAIC-GM-Wuling : 4.9% market share. Volkswagen : 4.6% market share. BMW, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, MG , and KIA featured in the top ten with market shares ranging from 3.6% to 2%. The top ten BEV companies accounted for 65% of global market share in 2023. Sales of EVs in 2023, including BEVs, PHEVs, and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), reached 13.1 million units, a 29.8% increase compared to 2022. This growth, while substantial, is a slowdown from the 54.2% increase between 2021 and 2022. What were the top Electric Car Brands in 2022 and 2021? In 2022, BYD overtook Tesla as the top producer of EVs when including PHEVs in the sales figures. BYD produced 1.8 million vehicles , a 211% increase from 2021, compared to Teslas 1.3 million units , which was a 40% increase over 2021. Tesla continued to dominate the BEV market, but BYDs inclusion of PHEVs helped boost its overall numbers. Although Tesla led in the BEV category, BYDs range of electric models helped it achieve higher overall sales. The EV industry reached a new high in 2022, with total production exceeding 10 million vehicles for the first time, up from 6.7 million in 2021. BYD s rapid growth positioned it at the forefront of the EV market. Tesla managed robust growth, despite intense competition from Chinese manufacturers such as Geely , which saw a 251% increase in production. Volkswagen (+10%), GM (+13%), and other well-known brands also saw growth but at a more moderate pace. What are the Leading Electric Vehicle Models? The Tesla Model Y topped the list with 1.2 million units delivered in 2023, marking a 57% increase from 771,000 in 2022 . The BYD Song Pro/Plus PHEV followed with 543,000 units in 2023 , up 32% from 410,000 in 2022 . Another one from Tesla, the Tesla Model 3 deliveries reached 529,000 in 2023 , an 11% rise from 476,000 in the previous year. Chinese carmakers produced more than half of all electric cars sold worldwide in 2023, despite accounting for just 10% of global car sales with internal combustion engines. These models demonstrate the robust growth and expanding reach of electric vehicles (EVs) in the automotive market. Learn more about which countries lead in EV sales .

The EV market grew by 24% year-on-year in June 2025 compared to June 2024 and increased by 7% compared to May 2025. Rho Motion Data Manager, Charles Lester, commented: Todays EV sales figures of the first half of 2025 show that China and Europe are steaming ahead in terms of the electric transition. Over one in two electric vehicles sold in the world are being bought in China and around half of purchased new cars in the country are electric. Despite some nervousness over subsidies, we expect this strong EV sales trend to continue over the course of the year. European growth, while strong, hasnt been uniform across the region. The UK and Germany are leading the way, leaving France in their dust as price-sensitive drivers continue to be at the mercy of subsidies. North America, and in particular Canada, is experiencing a slowdown of EV sales in 2025. With Trumps latest cuts in his Big Beautiful Bill, the USA could struggle to see any growth in the EV market overall in 2025. Snapshot electric vehicle sales in H1 2025 vs H1 2024, Year-to-Date (YTD)%: Global: 9.1 million, +28% China: 5.5 million, +32% Europe: 2.0 million, +26% North America: 0.9 million, +3% Rest of World: 0.7 million, +40% Europe The European EV market has grown by 26% in the first half of the year, reaching 2.0 million units sold. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales have grown by 26% YTD, bolstered by the rise in small-segment vehicles available to the European market, such as the Renault 4 and Renault 5, and automakers push to meet, now relaxed, tailpipe emissions targets. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) sales have grown by 27% with many Chinese manufacturers seeing this as a way around the European tariffs on BEVs. The Spanish market continues to excel, with 85% growth ytd. The Spanish market still has a strong incentive scheme that has helped propel EV sales in 2025, and it also extended the MOVES III scheme in April 2025 until the end of the year, resulting in strong EV sales in May and June. Major auto markets, such as Germany and the UK, are up 40% and 32% ytd, respectively. Meanwhile, France remains down at -13% following their subsidy cuts. North America Growth in the North American EV market (US, Canada, and Mexico) continues to slow down, with 3% growth now ytd. The Canadian market remains down at -23%, the Mexican market is up at 20%, and the US market has grown by 6%. Following President Trump signing the Big Beautiful Bill into law on 4 July 2025, all IRA consumer tax credits for new, used, and commercial EVs are withdrawn and will be terminated on 30 th September 2025. Just over half of EVs sold in the US this year have been eligible for the tax credit. We therefore expect a rise in EV sales before the elimination of the tax credit at the end of Q3, and then a sharp decline in demand in the final quarter of the year. China The Chinese market has increased by 32% ytd in the opening six months of the year, and has grown by 28% y-o-y despite the negative sentiment that has crept into the Chinese market. There have been reports that some cities subsidies have run out for the first half of the year, prompting expectations of a slowdown in the Chinese market. However, we are anticipating more funding to become available in the second half of the year, allowing EV sales to continue to grow in the country. We still expect the Chinese market to have strong growth in the final months of 2025. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Notes to Editors Rho Motion, a Benchmark Company, was founded in 201', 'images': [], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/worldwide', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://evcurvefuturist.com/2025/02/global-ev-sales-2024-final-figures-and-key-insights/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/electric-vehicle-market-101678', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/trends-in-electric-car-markets-2', 'content': \"Trends in electric car markets Global EV Outlook 2025 Analysis - IEA IEA Close Search Search About News Events Programmes Help centre IEA Skip navigation Search Energy system Chevron down Explore the energy system by fuel, technology or sector Fossil Fuels Renewables Electricity Low-Emissions Fuels Transport Industry Buildings Energy Efficiency and Demand Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Decarbonisation Enablers Buildings Energy Efficiency and Demand Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Decarbonisation Enablers Explore all Topics Chevron down Understand the biggest energy challenges Energy Security Artificial Intelligence Critical Minerals Access and Affordability Energy Innovation Investment Climate Change COP28: Tracking the Energy Outcomes Net Zero Emissions Russia's War on Ukraine Climate Change COP28: Tracking the Energy Outcomes Net Zero Emissions Russia's War on Ukraine Energy and Gender Energy and Water Fossil Fuel Subsidies Saving Energy Global Energy Crisis The IEA's 50th Anniversary All topics Countries Chevron down Explore the energy system by country or region Member countries Australia Austria Belgium Canada Czechia Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Ireland Italy Japan Korea Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Mexico New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Slovak Republic Spain Sweden Switzerland The Netherlands Trkiye United Kingdom United States Accession countries Chile Colombia Costa Rica Israel Association countries Argentina Brazil China Egypt India Indonesia Kenya Morocco Senegal Singapore South Africa Thailand Ukraine All Countries and Regions Data Chevron down Use, download and buy global energy data Data explorers Understand and manipulate data with easy to use explorers and trackers Data explorers Data sets Free and paid data sets from across the energy system available for download Data sets Policies database Past, existing or planned government policies and measures Policies database Chart Library Access every chart published across all IEA reports and analysis Chart Explore data Reports Chevron down Read the latest analysis from the IEA Oil Market Report - July 2025 Fuel report  July 2025 Energy and AI Flagship report  April 2025 Energy Technology Perspectives 2024 Flagship report  October 2024 World Energy Outlook 2024 Flagship report  October 2024 All reports Search Bag 1 User Profile Search Sign In Flyout close You are connecting via IP recognition from .

BYD produced 1.8 million vehicles , a 211% increase from 2021, compared to Teslas 1.3 million units , which was a 40% increase over 2021. Tesla continued to dominate the BEV market, but BYDs inclusion of PHEVs helped boost its overall numbers. Although Tesla led in the BEV category, BYDs range of electric models helped it achieve higher overall sales. The EV industry reached a new high in 2022, with total production exceeding 10 million vehicles for the first time, up from 6.7 million in 2021. BYD s rapid growth positioned it at the forefront of the EV market. Tesla managed robust growth, despite intense competition from Chinese manufacturers such as Geely , which saw a 251% increase in production. Volkswagen (+10%), GM (+13%), and other well-known brands also saw growth but at a more moderate pace. What are the Leading Electric Vehicle Models? The Tesla Model Y topped the list with 1.2 million units delivered in 2023, marking a 57% increase from 771,000 in 2022 . The BYD Song Pro/Plus PHEV followed with 543,000 units in 2023 , up 32% from 410,000 in 2022 . Another one from Tesla, the Tesla Model 3 deliveries reached 529,000 in 2023 , an 11% rise from 476,000 in the previous year. Chinese carmakers produced more than half of all electric cars sold worldwide in 2023, despite accounting for just 10% of global car sales with internal combustion engines. These models demonstrate the robust growth and expanding reach of electric vehicles (EVs) in the automotive market. Learn more about which countries lead in EV sales .

The EV market grew by 24% year-on-year in June 2025 compared to June 2024 and increased by 7% compared to May 2025. Rho Motion Data Manager, Charles Lester, commented: Todays EV sales figures of the first half of 2025 show that China and Europe are steaming ahead in terms of the electric transition. Over one in two electric vehicles sold in the world are being bought in China and around half of purchased new cars in the country are electric. Despite some nervousness over subsidies, we expect this strong EV sales trend to continue over the course of the year. European growth, while strong, hasnt been uniform across the region. The UK and Germany are leading the way, leaving France in their dust as price-sensitive drivers continue to be at the mercy of subsidies. North America, and in particular Canada, is experiencing a slowdown of EV sales in 2025. With Trumps latest cuts in his Big Beautiful Bill, the USA could struggle to see any growth in the EV market overall in 2025. Snapshot electric vehicle sales in H1 2025 vs H1 2024, Year-to-Date (YTD)%: Global: 9.1 million, +28% China: 5.5 million, +32% Europe: 2.0 million, +26% North America: 0.9 million, +3% Rest of World: 0.7 million, +40% Europe The European EV market has grown by 26% in the first half of the year, reaching 2.0 million units sold. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales have grown by 26% YTD, bolstered by the rise in small-segment vehicles available to the European market, such as the Renault 4 and Renault 5, and automakers push to meet, now relaxed, tailpipe emissions targets. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) sales have grown by 27% with many Chinese manufacturers seeing this as a way around the European tariffs on BEVs. The Spanish market continues to excel, with 85% growth ytd. The Spanish market still has a strong incentive scheme that has helped propel EV sales in 2025, and it also extended the MOVES III scheme in April 2025 until the end of the year, resulting in strong EV sales in May and June. Major auto markets, such as Germany and the UK, are up 40% and 32% ytd, respectively. Meanwhile, France remains down at -13% following their subsidy cuts. North America Growth in the North American EV market (US, Canada, and Mexico) continues to slow down, with 3% growth now ytd. The Canadian market remains down at -23%, the Mexican market is up at 20%, and the US market has grown by 6%. Following President Trump signing the Big Beautiful Bill into law on 4 July 2025, all IRA consumer tax credits for new, used, and commercial EVs are withdrawn and will be terminated on 30 th September 2025. Just over half of EVs sold in the US this year have been eligible for the tax credit. We therefore expect a rise in EV sales before the elimination of the tax credit at the end of Q3, and then a sharp decline in demand in the final quarter of the year. China The Chinese market has increased by 32% ytd in the opening six months of the year, and has grown by 28% y-o-y despite the negative sentiment that has crept into the Chinese market. There have been reports that some cities subsidies have run out for the first half of the year, prompting expectations of a slowdown in the Chinese market. However, we are anticipating more funding to become available in the second half of the year, allowing EV sales to continue to grow in the country. We still expect the Chinese market to have strong growth in the final months of 2025. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Notes to Editors Rho Motion, a Benchmark Company, was founded in 201', 'images': [], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/worldwide', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://evcurvefuturist.com/2025/02/global-ev-sales-2024-final-figures-and-key-insights/', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/electric-vehicle-market-101678', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",
