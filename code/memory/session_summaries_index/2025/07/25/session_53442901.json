By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-transport/global-electric-vehicle-sales-set-for-record-breaking-year-even-as-us-market-slows-sharply-bloombergnef-finds/', 'content': \"Global Electric Vehicle Sales Set for Record-Breaking Year, Even as US Market Slows Sharply, BloombergNEF Finds | BloombergNEF Skip to content Bloomberg the Company & Its Products The Company & its Products Bloomberg Terminal Demo Request Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Bloomberg Anywhere Login Bloomberg Customer Support Customer Support Bloomberg Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world For Customers Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Software Updates Manage Products and Account Information Support Americas +1 212 318 2000 EMEA +44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific +65 6212 1000 Company About Careers Inclusion at Bloomberg Tech at Bloomberg Philanthropy Sustainability Bloomberg Beta Communications Press Announcements Press Contacts Follow Facebook Instagram LinkedIn YouTube Products Bloomberg Terminal Data Trading Risk Compliance Indices Industry Products Bloomberg Law Bloomberg Tax Bloomberg Government BloombergNEF Media Bloomberg Markets Bloomberg Technology Bloomberg Pursuits Bloomberg Politics Bloomberg Opinion Bloomberg Businessweek Bloomberg Live Conferences Bloomberg Radio Bloomberg Television News Bureaus Media Services Bloomberg Media Distribution Advertising Company About Careers Inclusion at Bloomberg Tech at Bloomberg Philanthropy Sustainability Bloomberg Beta Communications Press Announcements Press Contacts Follow Facebook Instagram LinkedIn YouTube Products Bloomberg Terminal Data Trading Risk Compliance Indices Industry Products Bloomberg Law Bloomberg Tax Bloomberg Government BloombergNEF Media Bloomberg Markets Bloomberg Technology Bloomberg Pursuits Bloomberg Politics Bloomberg Opinion Bloomberg Businessweek Bloomberg Live Conferences Bloomberg Radio Bloomberg Television News Bureaus Media Services Bloomberg Media Distribution Advertising Bloomberg Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world For Customers Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Software Updates Manage Contracts and Orders Support Americas +1 212 318 2000 EMEA +44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific +65 6212 1000 BloombergNEF What we do Who we help Commodities Traders Review projections and risks within the commodities market.

Governments, businesses, and consumers are recognizing the importance of reducing carbon emissions, improving air quality, and moving toward more sustainable forms of mobility. To accelerate this transition, various countries are implementing policies and incentives designed to promote the adoption of EVs. These measures range from tax breaks and subsidies to infrastructure development and stricter emissions regulations. This article explores the global push for EVs, highlighting key policies and incentives shaping the future of electric mobility. The Importance of Electric Vehicles in Climate Policy The transportation sector accounts for nearly 25% of global carbon emissions, making it a critical target for reducing greenhouse gases. EVs, which produce zero tailpipe emissions, are seen as a crucial solution for meeting climate goals such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement. By replacing fossil fuel-powered vehicles with electric alternatives, countries can significantly reduce their carbon footprint while also addressing issues such as air pollution and energy security. The global effort to electrify transport is further supported by advancements in renewable energy, making it possible to power EVs with cleaner electricity, thereby maximizing their environmental benefits. However, to encourage widespread EV adoption, governments must implement supportive policies and create an enabling environment for EV market growth. Financial Incentives for EV Buyers One of the most direct ways governments promote EV adoption is through financial incentives aimed at reducing the cost of electric vehicles. Since EVs are typically more expensive than their ICE counterparts due to the cost of batteries and other technologies, these incentives play a crucial role in making EVs more affordable for consumers. Purchase Subsidies and Tax Credits: Many countries offer subsidies or tax credits to reduce the upfront cost of buying an EV. For example, in the United States, the federal government provides a tax credit of up to $7,500 for EV purchases, while some states offer additional rebates. In China, buyers can receive substantial subsidies as part of the governments effort to boost domestic EV production and sales. Exemption from Sales and Import Taxes: Several nations, including Norway and the Netherlands, have eliminated import and sales taxes for EVs, making them significantly cheaper compared to gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. Norway, in particular, leads the world in EV market share, with nearly 80% of new car sales being electric in 2022, thanks to a combination of generous tax incentives and other supportive policies. Reduced Registration Fees: Many governments reduce or waive registration fees for EV owners, further lowering the total cost of ownership. Some regions also offer lower insurance premiums for EVs, recognizing their typically lower maintenance costs and reduced risk of breakdowns. Non-Financial Incentives In addition to financial incentives, governments also offer a range of non-financial benefits to encourage EV adoption. These perks are aimed at making EV ownership more convenient and attractive compared to traditional vehicles.

Global electric vehicle (EV) markets today differ widely, shaped by different levels of policy support, corporate activity, consumer preference and awareness, driving patterns, and cultural specificities. The success of EVs is being driven by multiple factors. Sustained policy support is the main pillar. Public spending on subsidies and incentives for EVs nearly doubled in 2021 to nearly USD 30 billion. A growing number of countries have pledged to phase out internal combustion engines or have significant vehicle electrification targets for the coming decades. The role of policy has been particularly significant in steering corporate strategy towards electrification and enabling consumer uptake. Global Expansion of Incentives and Subsidies EV Adaptation and Supply Chains Incensing Demand for Light-Duty Vehicles Purchase Incentives Charging Infrastructure Incentives Economically Effective Strategies/Subsidies for Consumers Global Expansion of Incentives and Subsidies In todays major EV markets, including China, Europe, and the United States, early adoption was jump-started in many cases by policies to spur demand, such as vehicle purchase incentives. Direct incentives for carmakers were also used in China. Many of these countries and regions are now seeing EV markets maturing , for which sales shares are increasing rapidly. More developed markets, such as China and several European countries, are now progressively decreasing or phasing out incentive schemes for electric cars and shifting focus towards other segments, such as heavy transport and charging. EV Adaptation and Supply Chains Some global leaders in major markets have further increased their targets for EV adoption and are working to address other parts of EV supply chains, such as through policy support for vehicle and battery manufacturing and critical mineral supply chains. Many other countries outside the major markets have also started introducing policies to support EV adoption in recent years, for the first time in some cases. Policies are also shifting towards electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), or charging, and currently, almost 80% of global EV sales (LDV and HDV) are covered by EVSE-related policy. Countries are increasingly dedicating funds to EVSE deployment, acknowledging that a lack of charging infrastructure can be a critical barrier to EV adoption. Incensing Demand for Light-Duty Vehicles As in recent years, most policies supporting EVs target the electric light-duty vehicle (LDV) segment, for which market maturity is most advanced and vehicle availability is greatest. In 2022, more than 90% of global sales of LDVs were covered by the policy that encourages EV uptake . Typical policies include fuel economy and pollutant standards; zero-emission vehicle mandates; economic and budgetary regulation for fuels and vehicles, such as through fiscal regimes and taxation; purchase incentives and subsidies; and bans on internal combustion engine (ICE)-only vehicles. Purchase Incentives Many countries offer direct financial incentives to reduce the upfront cost of purchasing an electric vehicle. These incentives may include tax credits, rebates, grants, or discounts on the purchase price. The amount varies widely and may be influenced by factors such as the EV's battery size, range, or purchase price. Charging Infrastructure Incentives Many countries invest in building a robust EV charging infrastructure by offering subsidies or grants to businesses and local governments that install charging stations .

Showcased during SNE Battery Day 2024, this breakthrough isnt just an incremental improvementit represents a fundamental leap forward in EV battery performance, safety, and longevity. This battery technology, built using solid-state electrolytes and advanced energy-dense materials, addresses the three biggest pain points in the EV space: limited range, long charging times, and battery degradation. If adopted at scale, it could finally eliminate range anxiety and bring EV adoption into a new golden era. What Makes Samsungs Battery Different? Samsung SDIs new battery boasts an energy density of approximately 500 Wh/kg , nearly double that of conventional lithium-ion batteries. The higher density allows for greater range in a smaller, lighter form factora critical advantage for both performance and design flexibility in EVs. The use of solid-state electrolytes rather than flammable liquid ones significantly enhances safety. Traditional EV batteries are prone to thermal runaway and fires under extreme conditions. In contrast, solid-state cells are far less volatile and can better withstand high temperatures and impacts, making them ideal for mass-market vehicles and high-performance EVs alike. Moreover, this battery has demonstrated over 1,000 charge-discharge cycles with minimal capacity loss , supporting the claim of a 20-year usable life. Thats potentially double or triple the lifespan of current-generation EV batteries. Unmatched Charging Speed Perhaps the most headline-grabbing feature is its 9-minute charging time . In ideal conditions, users can replenish 80% of the battery in under 10 minutescomparable to the time spent filling up a gasoline tank. This milestone was achieved by improving lithium-ion diffusion rates and minimizing dendrite formation, which historically has limited fast-charging in solid-state designs. The battery also includes integrated thermal management systems and intelligent voltage balancing circuits that maintain optimal temperature during rapid charging. Combined with 800V EV architectures already being deployed by carmakers, Samsungs tech may finally make ultra-fast EV pit stops a practical reality. Pilot Production and Launch Timeline Samsung is currently in the pilot production phase at its Cheonan facility, with large-scale output expected by late 2025 or early 2026 . The company aims to supply the new battery first to luxury electric vehicles , including high-end sedans and performance SUVs. Partnerships with key automakers are reportedly underway, with whispers of collaboration with BMW, Hyundai, and even Lucid Motors. Samsung plans to scale the technology to mainstream EVs by developing cobalt-free versions and exploring lithium iron phosphate (LFP) variants to reduce costs and reliance on scarce materials. Environmental and Economic Impact A battery that lasts 20 years with minimal degradation could reduce EV battery waste by up to 70% over the next two decades. Fewer replacements also translate into lower total ownership costs, potentially making EVs more affordable in the long term. In addition, faster charging means fewer chargers are needed per driver, easing the infrastructure burden and enabling smarter grid planning.

Insights from YouGov's BrandIndex, Profiles, and surveys tools offer a comprehensive view of key shifts for 2024. From fuel choices to electric vehicle adoption and evolving automotive technology, these trends reveal what matters most to todays car buyers and owners. The push for electric vehicles Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to gain popularity, though significant barriers remain. Hybrid vehicles appeal to 67% of Americans due to their lower running costs , highlighting a transitional interest in fuel-efficient alternatives. But whats the state of EV adoption in the US in 2024? Range anxiety and limited charging infrastructure remain top concerns why consumers are not considering buying an EV. Financial incentives play a crucial role in boosting EV sales. Reduced charging costs (43%), reduced insurance costs (44%) and government subsidies on EV purchases (39%) are among the top incentives that can make EVs somewhat more or much more financially attractive to consumers. But broader adoption will depend on addressing these practical challenges. When on vacation only 18% of Americans say they would prefer renting an electric or hybrid car rental . Free or discounted charging is most likely to incentivize those picking gas-powered vehicles to rent EVs. Whats driving electric vehicle adoption?

Why? Shoppers Owners Dealers Sign In Shoppers Owners Dealers Sign In Research Who is buying electric cars this year? And why? Technical Input By Written by Liz Najman Researcher December 11, 2024 Interested in finding an offer for your EV? Sell your EV with Recurrent Summarize with: ChatGPT Perplexity Claude Google AI Grok Sell Your EV to Experts Share Research Who is buying electric cars this year? And why? It can be hard to unpack data about EV shopping and purchases: who is buying electric cars, why people buy them, and what may happen to demand if the EV tax credits are repealed. One factor is that many studies can point to different outcomes, at least at first glance. 97% of customers who leased EVs and 81% of customers who purchased new EVs received a full or partial tax credit this year. ( JD Power ) Only 64% thought they used the federal EV tax credit. ( Plug In America ) 77% to 67% of EV owners would have bought an electric car without any federal funding. ( NBER study ) Lets dive into the current state of who is buying electric cars, what they are buying, and how happy they are with their purchases. 2024 - fewer EV shoppers but more EV drivers A 2024 Gallup poll found that 44% of Americans are either seriously considering or potentially considering EV purchase in the future. This number decreased from 55% in 2023, even as EV purchases leapt from 4% to nearly 7%, with new EVsales on their way to an expected 11% by year end. How is this possible? One key factor is that Americans who already drive EV, love them. Experian found that 77% of EV drivers plan to stay electric. Plug-in Americas drivers reported that 89.4% of them will purchase another electric car. Globally, 92% of drivers plan to stay electric. Since so many EVs are leased , turnover happens every 36 months, which explains some of the growth in ownership. Who is Buying an Electric Vehicle in 2024? EV ownership trends show patterns that are reflected in many of 2024 surveys, including Plug In America, Experian, JD Power, and Gallup. Current EV ownership skews towards Generation X and Millennials, while Generation Z and those 65 and older are less likely to own one. Interestingly, Plug In America found that EV owner satisfaction increases with driver age, with drivers 75+ much more likely to purchase another EV than drivers 18-24 years old (more on that below). Age : Only 3% of those aged 65+ own an EV, and they are significantly less likely to consider purchasing one than younger generations. Among Gen Z and Millennials, 24% and 32% respectively say they are very likely to consider an EV, though these percentages have dropped since 2023, likely due to affordability concerns. Gender : EV ownership is 70% male and 30% female, compared to a more balanced 60/40 male-to-female ratio across all vehicle ownership. Household Characteristics : 85% of EV owners live in single-family homes, where charging is easy and convenient. Homes with one EV often have additional vehicles that are: Gasoline-powered (81%) Hybrid (14%) Electric (12%) Interestingly, multi-child households are far less likely to adopt EVs. This is probably due to the lack of three-row models that can accommodate a family. 2024 saw a new crop of such vehicles so future surveys may show this trend reversing. Income : Ownership and intent to purchase an EV correlate with income. And although intent to purchase an EV has dropped across the board this year, lower-income groups show the most significant drop in interest. Commuting and Usage Patterns : Long commutes are associated with reduced interest in EVs, likely influenced by lower gas prices this year. Only 24% of long-distance commuters are likely to purchase an EV, down from 37% in 2023. This is too bad, since long distance drivers can save the most money and emissions if they switch to electric. For multi-car households, 68% are open to considering an EV, compared to 47% among single-car households.', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/electric-vehicle-adoption-trends-its-not-all-grim.html', 'content': '[error] Timeout while extracting content', 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-electric-vehicle-consideration-evc-study', 'content': 'Attention Required! | Cloudflare Please enable cookies.

By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-transport/global-electric-vehicle-sales-set-for-record-breaking-year-even-as-us-market-slows-sharply-bloombergnef-finds/', 'content': \"Global Electric Vehicle Sales Set for Record-Breaking Year, Even as US Market Slows Sharply, BloombergNEF Finds | BloombergNEF Skip to content Bloomberg the Company & Its Products The Company & its Products Bloomberg Terminal Demo Request Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Bloomberg Anywhere Login Bloomberg Customer Support Customer Support Bloomberg Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world For Customers Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Software Updates Manage Products and Account Information Support Americas +1 212 318 2000 EMEA +44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific +65 6212 1000 Company About Careers Inclusion at Bloomberg Tech at Bloomberg Philanthropy Sustainability Bloomberg Beta Communications Press Announcements Press Contacts Follow Facebook Instagram LinkedIn YouTube Products Bloomberg Terminal Data Trading Risk Compliance Indices Industry Products Bloomberg Law Bloomberg Tax Bloomberg Government BloombergNEF Media Bloomberg Markets Bloomberg Technology Bloomberg Pursuits Bloomberg Politics Bloomberg Opinion Bloomberg Businessweek Bloomberg Live Conferences Bloomberg Radio Bloomberg Television News Bureaus Media Services Bloomberg Media Distribution Advertising Company About Careers Inclusion at Bloomberg Tech at Bloomberg Philanthropy Sustainability Bloomberg Beta Communications Press Announcements Press Contacts Follow Facebook Instagram LinkedIn YouTube Products Bloomberg Terminal Data Trading Risk Compliance Indices Industry Products Bloomberg Law Bloomberg Tax Bloomberg Government BloombergNEF Media Bloomberg Markets Bloomberg Technology Bloomberg Pursuits Bloomberg Politics Bloomberg Opinion Bloomberg Businessweek Bloomberg Live Conferences Bloomberg Radio Bloomberg Television News Bureaus Media Services Bloomberg Media Distribution Advertising Bloomberg Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world For Customers Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Software Updates Manage Contracts and Orders Support Americas +1 212 318 2000 EMEA +44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific +65 6212 1000 BloombergNEF What we do Who we help Commodities Traders Review projections and risks within the commodities market.

Governments, businesses, and consumers are recognizing the importance of reducing carbon emissions, improving air quality, and moving toward more sustainable forms of mobility. To accelerate this transition, various countries are implementing policies and incentives designed to promote the adoption of EVs. These measures range from tax breaks and subsidies to infrastructure development and stricter emissions regulations. This article explores the global push for EVs, highlighting key policies and incentives shaping the future of electric mobility. The Importance of Electric Vehicles in Climate Policy The transportation sector accounts for nearly 25% of global carbon emissions, making it a critical target for reducing greenhouse gases. EVs, which produce zero tailpipe emissions, are seen as a crucial solution for meeting climate goals such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement. By replacing fossil fuel-powered vehicles with electric alternatives, countries can significantly reduce their carbon footprint while also addressing issues such as air pollution and energy security. The global effort to electrify transport is further supported by advancements in renewable energy, making it possible to power EVs with cleaner electricity, thereby maximizing their environmental benefits. However, to encourage widespread EV adoption, governments must implement supportive policies and create an enabling environment for EV market growth. Financial Incentives for EV Buyers One of the most direct ways governments promote EV adoption is through financial incentives aimed at reducing the cost of electric vehicles. Since EVs are typically more expensive than their ICE counterparts due to the cost of batteries and other technologies, these incentives play a crucial role in making EVs more affordable for consumers. Purchase Subsidies and Tax Credits: Many countries offer subsidies or tax credits to reduce the upfront cost of buying an EV. For example, in the United States, the federal government provides a tax credit of up to $7,500 for EV purchases, while some states offer additional rebates. In China, buyers can receive substantial subsidies as part of the governments effort to boost domestic EV production and sales. Exemption from Sales and Import Taxes: Several nations, including Norway and the Netherlands, have eliminated import and sales taxes for EVs, making them significantly cheaper compared to gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. Norway, in particular, leads the world in EV market share, with nearly 80% of new car sales being electric in 2022, thanks to a combination of generous tax incentives and other supportive policies. Reduced Registration Fees: Many governments reduce or waive registration fees for EV owners, further lowering the total cost of ownership. Some regions also offer lower insurance premiums for EVs, recognizing their typically lower maintenance costs and reduced risk of breakdowns. Non-Financial Incentives In addition to financial incentives, governments also offer a range of non-financial benefits to encourage EV adoption. These perks are aimed at making EV ownership more convenient and attractive compared to traditional vehicles.

Global electric vehicle (EV) markets today differ widely, shaped by different levels of policy support, corporate activity, consumer preference and awareness, driving patterns, and cultural specificities. The success of EVs is being driven by multiple factors. Sustained policy support is the main pillar. Public spending on subsidies and incentives for EVs nearly doubled in 2021 to nearly USD 30 billion. A growing number of countries have pledged to phase out internal combustion engines or have significant vehicle electrification targets for the coming decades. The role of policy has been particularly significant in steering corporate strategy towards electrification and enabling consumer uptake. Global Expansion of Incentives and Subsidies EV Adaptation and Supply Chains Incensing Demand for Light-Duty Vehicles Purchase Incentives Charging Infrastructure Incentives Economically Effective Strategies/Subsidies for Consumers Global Expansion of Incentives and Subsidies In todays major EV markets, including China, Europe, and the United States, early adoption was jump-started in many cases by policies to spur demand, such as vehicle purchase incentives. Direct incentives for carmakers were also used in China. Many of these countries and regions are now seeing EV markets maturing , for which sales shares are increasing rapidly. More developed markets, such as China and several European countries, are now progressively decreasing or phasing out incentive schemes for electric cars and shifting focus towards other segments, such as heavy transport and charging. EV Adaptation and Supply Chains Some global leaders in major markets have further increased their targets for EV adoption and are working to address other parts of EV supply chains, such as through policy support for vehicle and battery manufacturing and critical mineral supply chains. Many other countries outside the major markets have also started introducing policies to support EV adoption in recent years, for the first time in some cases. Policies are also shifting towards electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), or charging, and currently, almost 80% of global EV sales (LDV and HDV) are covered by EVSE-related policy. Countries are increasingly dedicating funds to EVSE deployment, acknowledging that a lack of charging infrastructure can be a critical barrier to EV adoption. Incensing Demand for Light-Duty Vehicles As in recent years, most policies supporting EVs target the electric light-duty vehicle (LDV) segment, for which market maturity is most advanced and vehicle availability is greatest. In 2022, more than 90% of global sales of LDVs were covered by the policy that encourages EV uptake . Typical policies include fuel economy and pollutant standards; zero-emission vehicle mandates; economic and budgetary regulation for fuels and vehicles, such as through fiscal regimes and taxation; purchase incentives and subsidies; and bans on internal combustion engine (ICE)-only vehicles. Purchase Incentives Many countries offer direct financial incentives to reduce the upfront cost of purchasing an electric vehicle. These incentives may include tax credits, rebates, grants, or discounts on the purchase price. The amount varies widely and may be influenced by factors such as the EV's battery size, range, or purchase price. Charging Infrastructure Incentives Many countries invest in building a robust EV charging infrastructure by offering subsidies or grants to businesses and local governments that install charging stations .

Showcased during SNE Battery Day 2024, this breakthrough isnt just an incremental improvementit represents a fundamental leap forward in EV battery performance, safety, and longevity. This battery technology, built using solid-state electrolytes and advanced energy-dense materials, addresses the three biggest pain points in the EV space: limited range, long charging times, and battery degradation. If adopted at scale, it could finally eliminate range anxiety and bring EV adoption into a new golden era. What Makes Samsungs Battery Different? Samsung SDIs new battery boasts an energy density of approximately 500 Wh/kg , nearly double that of conventional lithium-ion batteries. The higher density allows for greater range in a smaller, lighter form factora critical advantage for both performance and design flexibility in EVs. The use of solid-state electrolytes rather than flammable liquid ones significantly enhances safety. Traditional EV batteries are prone to thermal runaway and fires under extreme conditions. In contrast, solid-state cells are far less volatile and can better withstand high temperatures and impacts, making them ideal for mass-market vehicles and high-performance EVs alike. Moreover, this battery has demonstrated over 1,000 charge-discharge cycles with minimal capacity loss , supporting the claim of a 20-year usable life. Thats potentially double or triple the lifespan of current-generation EV batteries. Unmatched Charging Speed Perhaps the most headline-grabbing feature is its 9-minute charging time . In ideal conditions, users can replenish 80% of the battery in under 10 minutescomparable to the time spent filling up a gasoline tank. This milestone was achieved by improving lithium-ion diffusion rates and minimizing dendrite formation, which historically has limited fast-charging in solid-state designs. The battery also includes integrated thermal management systems and intelligent voltage balancing circuits that maintain optimal temperature during rapid charging. Combined with 800V EV architectures already being deployed by carmakers, Samsungs tech may finally make ultra-fast EV pit stops a practical reality. Pilot Production and Launch Timeline Samsung is currently in the pilot production phase at its Cheonan facility, with large-scale output expected by late 2025 or early 2026 . The company aims to supply the new battery first to luxury electric vehicles , including high-end sedans and performance SUVs. Partnerships with key automakers are reportedly underway, with whispers of collaboration with BMW, Hyundai, and even Lucid Motors. Samsung plans to scale the technology to mainstream EVs by developing cobalt-free versions and exploring lithium iron phosphate (LFP) variants to reduce costs and reliance on scarce materials. Environmental and Economic Impact A battery that lasts 20 years with minimal degradation could reduce EV battery waste by up to 70% over the next two decades. Fewer replacements also translate into lower total ownership costs, potentially making EVs more affordable in the long term. In addition, faster charging means fewer chargers are needed per driver, easing the infrastructure burden and enabling smarter grid planning.

Insights from YouGov's BrandIndex, Profiles, and surveys tools offer a comprehensive view of key shifts for 2024. From fuel choices to electric vehicle adoption and evolving automotive technology, these trends reveal what matters most to todays car buyers and owners. The push for electric vehicles Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to gain popularity, though significant barriers remain. Hybrid vehicles appeal to 67% of Americans due to their lower running costs , highlighting a transitional interest in fuel-efficient alternatives. But whats the state of EV adoption in the US in 2024? Range anxiety and limited charging infrastructure remain top concerns why consumers are not considering buying an EV. Financial incentives play a crucial role in boosting EV sales. Reduced charging costs (43%), reduced insurance costs (44%) and government subsidies on EV purchases (39%) are among the top incentives that can make EVs somewhat more or much more financially attractive to consumers. But broader adoption will depend on addressing these practical challenges. When on vacation only 18% of Americans say they would prefer renting an electric or hybrid car rental . Free or discounted charging is most likely to incentivize those picking gas-powered vehicles to rent EVs. Whats driving electric vehicle adoption?

Technical Input By Written by Liz Najman Researcher December 11, 2024 Interested in finding an offer for your EV? Sell your EV with Recurrent Summarize with: ChatGPT Perplexity Claude Google AI Grok Sell Your EV to Experts Share Research Who is buying electric cars this year? And why? It can be hard to unpack data about EV shopping and purchases: who is buying electric cars, why people buy them, and what may happen to demand if the EV tax credits are repealed. One factor is that many studies can point to different outcomes, at least at first glance. 97% of customers who leased EVs and 81% of customers who purchased new EVs received a full or partial tax credit this year. ( JD Power ) Only 64% thought they used the federal EV tax credit. ( Plug In America ) 77% to 67% of EV owners would have bought an electric car without any federal funding. ( NBER study ) Lets dive into the current state of who is buying electric cars, what they are buying, and how happy they are with their purchases. 2024 - fewer EV shoppers but more EV drivers A 2024 Gallup poll found that 44% of Americans are either seriously considering or potentially considering EV purchase in the future. This number decreased from 55% in 2023, even as EV purchases leapt from 4% to nearly 7%, with new EVsales on their way to an expected 11% by year end. How is this possible? One key factor is that Americans who already drive EV, love them. Experian found that 77% of EV drivers plan to stay electric. Plug-in Americas drivers reported that 89.4% of them will purchase another electric car. Globally, 92% of drivers plan to stay electric. Since so many EVs are leased , turnover happens every 36 months, which explains some of the growth in ownership. Who is Buying an Electric Vehicle in 2024? EV ownership trends show patterns that are reflected in many of 2024 surveys, including Plug In America, Experian, JD Power, and Gallup. Current EV ownership skews towards Generation X and Millennials, while Generation Z and those 65 and older are less likely to own one. Interestingly, Plug In America found that EV owner satisfaction increases with driver age, with drivers 75+ much more likely to purchase another EV than drivers 18-24 years old (more on that below). Age : Only 3% of those aged 65+ own an EV, and they are significantly less likely to consider purchasing one than younger generations. Among Gen Z and Millennials, 24% and 32% respectively say they are very likely to consider an EV, though these percentages have dropped since 2023, likely due to affordability concerns. Gender : EV ownership is 70% male and 30% female, compared to a more balanced 60/40 male-to-female ratio across all vehicle ownership. Household Characteristics : 85% of EV owners live in single-family homes, where charging is easy and convenient. Homes with one EV often have additional vehicles that are: Gasoline-powered (81%) Hybrid (14%) Electric (12%) Interestingly, multi-child households are far less likely to adopt EVs. This is probably due to the lack of three-row models that can accommodate a family. 2024 saw a new crop of such vehicles so future surveys may show this trend reversing. Income : Ownership and intent to purchase an EV correlate with income. And although intent to purchase an EV has dropped across the board this year, lower-income groups show the most significant drop in interest. Commuting and Usage Patterns : Long commutes are associated with reduced interest in EVs, likely influenced by lower gas prices this year. Only 24% of long-distance commuters are likely to purchase an EV, down from 37% in 2023. This is too bad, since long distance drivers can save the most money and emissions if they switch to electric. For multi-car households, 68% are open to considering an EV, compared to 47% among single-car households.', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/electric-vehicle-adoption-trends-its-not-all-grim.html', 'content': '[error] Timeout while extracting content', 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-electric-vehicle-consideration-evc-study', 'content': 'Attention Required! | Cloudflare Please enable cookies.
