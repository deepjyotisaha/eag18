By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://roadgenius.com/cars/ev/statistics/sales-by-automaker/', 'content': 'EV Sales by Brand | 2023 - 2024 Global Statistics & Forecasts Resources Global Tourism Statistics & Trends 2023 and 2024 Auto Industry Trends EV Sales by Automaker EV Sales by Country EV Charging Stations in the USA EV Charging Stations in Canada EV Charging Stations in the UK Car Rental Campervan Rental Global EV Sales by Top Automakers Page last updated: 5 October 2024 The electric vehicle (EV) market is continuously expanding, with major automakers increasing production and sales to meet rising demand. Overview Toggle What Are the Top Electric Vehicle Brands Globally? What were the top Electric Car Brands in 2022 and 2021? What are the Leading Electric Vehicle Models? What are the future projections for the EV Industry? What Are the Top Electric Vehicle Brands Globally? Tesla : Held the largest global EV market share in 2023 at 19.9% . However, its expected to lose its leading position to BYD in 2024 . BYD : The Chinese automaker closely followed Tesla in 2023 with a 17.1% market share. In Q4 2023, BYD outsold Tesla by delivering 526,000 units compared to Teslas 485,000 units. Analysts predict BYD will overtake Tesla in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales by the end of 2024. Other Notable Brands: GAC Aion : 5.2% market share. SAIC-GM-Wuling : 4.9% market share. Volkswagen : 4.6% market share. BMW, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, MG , and KIA featured in the top ten with market shares ranging from 3.6% to 2%. The top ten BEV companies accounted for 65% of global market share in 2023. Sales of EVs in 2023, including BEVs, PHEVs, and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), reached 13.1 million units, a 29.8% increase compared to 2022. This growth, while substantial, is a slowdown from the 54.2% increase between 2021 and 2022. What were the top Electric Car Brands in 2022 and 2021? In 2022, BYD overtook Tesla as the top producer of EVs when including PHEVs in the sales figures. BYD produced 1.8 million vehicles , a 211% increase from 2021, compared to Teslas 1.3 million units , which was a 40% increase over 2021. Tesla continued to dominate the BEV market, but BYDs inclusion of PHEVs helped boost its overall numbers. Although Tesla led in the BEV category, BYDs range of electric models helped it achieve higher overall sales. The EV industry reached a new high in 2022, with total production exceeding 10 million vehicles for the first time, up from 6.7 million in 2021. BYD s rapid growth positioned it at the forefront of the EV market. Tesla managed robust growth, despite intense competition from Chinese manufacturers such as Geely , which saw a 251% increase in production. Volkswagen (+10%), GM (+13%), and other well-known brands also saw growth but at a more moderate pace. What are the Leading Electric Vehicle Models? The Tesla Model Y topped the list with 1.2 million units delivered in 2023, marking a 57% increase from 771,000 in 2022 . The BYD Song Pro/Plus PHEV followed with 543,000 units in 2023 , up 32% from 410,000 in 2022 . Another one from Tesla, the Tesla Model 3 deliveries reached 529,000 in 2023 , an 11% rise from 476,000 in the previous year. Chinese carmakers produced more than half of all electric cars sold worldwide in 2023, despite accounting for just 10% of global car sales with internal combustion engines. These models demonstrate the robust growth and expanding reach of electric vehicles (EVs) in the automotive market. Learn more about which countries lead in EV sales .

By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://roadgenius.com/cars/ev/statistics/sales-by-automaker/', 'content': 'EV Sales by Brand | 2023 - 2024 Global Statistics & Forecasts Resources Global Tourism Statistics & Trends 2023 and 2024 Auto Industry Trends EV Sales by Automaker EV Sales by Country EV Charging Stations in the USA EV Charging Stations in Canada EV Charging Stations in the UK Car Rental Campervan Rental Global EV Sales by Top Automakers Page last updated: 5 October 2024 The electric vehicle (EV) market is continuously expanding, with major automakers increasing production and sales to meet rising demand. Overview Toggle What Are the Top Electric Vehicle Brands Globally? What were the top Electric Car Brands in 2022 and 2021? What are the Leading Electric Vehicle Models? What are the future projections for the EV Industry? What Are the Top Electric Vehicle Brands Globally? Tesla : Held the largest global EV market share in 2023 at 19.9% . However, its expected to lose its leading position to BYD in 2024 . BYD : The Chinese automaker closely followed Tesla in 2023 with a 17.1% market share. In Q4 2023, BYD outsold Tesla by delivering 526,000 units compared to Teslas 485,000 units. Analysts predict BYD will overtake Tesla in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales by the end of 2024. Other Notable Brands: GAC Aion : 5.2% market share. SAIC-GM-Wuling : 4.9% market share. Volkswagen : 4.6% market share. BMW, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, MG , and KIA featured in the top ten with market shares ranging from 3.6% to 2%. The top ten BEV companies accounted for 65% of global market share in 2023. Sales of EVs in 2023, including BEVs, PHEVs, and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), reached 13.1 million units, a 29.8% increase compared to 2022. This growth, while substantial, is a slowdown from the 54.2% increase between 2021 and 2022. What were the top Electric Car Brands in 2022 and 2021? In 2022, BYD overtook Tesla as the top producer of EVs when including PHEVs in the sales figures. BYD produced 1.8 million vehicles , a 211% increase from 2021, compared to Teslas 1.3 million units , which was a 40% increase over 2021. Tesla continued to dominate the BEV market, but BYDs inclusion of PHEVs helped boost its overall numbers. Although Tesla led in the BEV category, BYDs range of electric models helped it achieve higher overall sales. The EV industry reached a new high in 2022, with total production exceeding 10 million vehicles for the first time, up from 6.7 million in 2021. BYD s rapid growth positioned it at the forefront of the EV market. Tesla managed robust growth, despite intense competition from Chinese manufacturers such as Geely , which saw a 251% increase in production. Volkswagen (+10%), GM (+13%), and other well-known brands also saw growth but at a more moderate pace. What are the Leading Electric Vehicle Models? The Tesla Model Y topped the list with 1.2 million units delivered in 2023, marking a 57% increase from 771,000 in 2022 . The BYD Song Pro/Plus PHEV followed with 543,000 units in 2023 , up 32% from 410,000 in 2022 . Another one from Tesla, the Tesla Model 3 deliveries reached 529,000 in 2023 , an 11% rise from 476,000 in the previous year. Chinese carmakers produced more than half of all electric cars sold worldwide in 2023, despite accounting for just 10% of global car sales with internal combustion engines. These models demonstrate the robust growth and expanding reach of electric vehicles (EVs) in the automotive market. Learn more about which countries lead in EV sales .
