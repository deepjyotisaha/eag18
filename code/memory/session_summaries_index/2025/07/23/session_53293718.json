The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

The XUV 3XO secured this accolade for both adult and child occupant protection, underlining Mahindras focus on providing world-class safety features in its vehicles. This latest recognition comes on the heels of Bharat NCAP's recent safety assessments of other prominent SUVs, including Tata models and the Citroen Basalt, as well as Mahindras own Thar Roxx and XUV 400 EV, both of which also earned 5-star ratings. The XUV 3XO demonstrated strong safety performance in multiple areas of testing. It achieved a remarkable total score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. In the frontal offset deformable barrier test, the SUV exhibited excellent protection for the co-driver, with good ratings across all body regions. However, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings of adequate to marginal due to the impact forces recorded during the collision. Despite these minor deductions, protection to the driver's head, hip, and thigh was rated as good, reinforcing the XUV 3XOs overall structural integrity and crashworthiness. The XUV 3XO excelled in the side barrier and pole impact tests, securing a full 16 out of 16 points .

Mahindras engineering expertise was evident, as the SUV delivered comprehensive protection to the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showcasing its robust design and stringent safety standards. In terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO also performed admirably, earning a total score of 43 out of 49 .

The test evaluated the ability of child restraint systems to effectively secure young passengers during high-impact situations. The XUV 3XO accommodated CRS installations with ease, ensuring full protection for child passengers. Bharat NCAP tested both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant of the XUV 3XO. The safety ratings are applicable across all variants, reflecting Mahindras commitment to offering consistent safety standards, regardless of trim level. The XUV 3XOs impressive safety performance is backed by a comprehensive suite of standard safety features. The SUV comes equipped with six airbags as a standard offering across all trims, ensuring superior protection for all occupants. Additionally, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) are standard, enhancing the vehicles stability and control in various driving conditions. Seat belt reminders are also provided for all seating positions, encouraging passengers to use seat belts at all times and thereby boosting overall safety. For customers opting for the higher-end variants, Mahindra offers Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) . This package includes features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking, adding another layer of safety and convenience for drivers. These technologies are designed to mitigate the risk of collisions and assist drivers in maintaining optimal control over the vehicle.

Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result Home Car News Bike News EV News Comparisons Featured About Privacy No Result View All Result No Result View All Result What is Mahindra XUV3XOs Safety Rating? by Harsh Kashyap 1 year ago in Featured A A A A Reset Mahindra XUV300 Global NCAP Safety Rating The next topic in this series is Mahindra XUV3XO safety rating. The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO emerges as a compelling contender in the competitive compact SUV segment. This analysis delves into the vehicle's features, strengths, weaknesses, target audience, and competitive landscape, based on the provided data. \n\n**Overall Features Overview:**\n\nThe XUV 3XO presents a well-rounded package with a strong emphasis on performance, safety, and modern features. The availability of both petrol and diesel engine options, coupled with manual and automatic transmission choices, broadens its appeal to a diverse range of buyers. Key highlights include:\n\n*   **Powerful Engine Options:** The 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine, producing 130PS/230Nm, positions the XUV 3XO as one of the most powerful in its class. The 1.5L diesel engine offers a good blend of performance and fuel efficiency.\n*   **Advanced Safety Features:** The inclusion of Level 2 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) is a significant advantage, offering features such as forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control, enhancing safety and driver convenience.\n*   **Premium Interior and Features:** The soft-touch materials on the dashboard and door pads, along with the panoramic sunroof (claimed to be the largest in the segment), contribute to a more upscale and enjoyable cabin experience.\n*   **Connected Car Technology:** With over 60 connected car features, the XUV 3XO offers a modern and tech-savvy experience, allowing users to stay connected and in control of their vehicle.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Performance:** The powerful turbo-petrol engine provides excellent performance and drivability, making it a fun-to-drive option in the segment.\n*   **Safety:** The inclusion of Level 2 ADAS features significantly enhances the safety quotient of the vehicle.\n*   **Features:** The XUV 3XO is packed with features, including a panoramic sunroof, soft-touch materials, connected car technology, and a large touchscreen infotainment system, offering a premium experience.\n*   **Value Proposition:** The XUV 3XO offers a compelling value proposition, providing a lot of features and performance at a competitive price point.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Ride Quality:** While the feature list is extensive, some reviews indicate that ride quality can be improved, especially on uneven road surfaces.\n*   **Long-Term Reliability:** As a relatively new model, the long-term reliability of the XUV 3XO is yet to be established. Potential buyers should consider this factor.\n*   **Brand Perception:** While Mahindra has made significant strides in recent years, it still lags behind some established players in terms of brand perception and customer service.\n*   **Subjective Luxury:** The term luxury is subjective, and while the XUV 3XO offers premium features, it may not meet the expectations of buyers seeking a truly luxurious experience.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO is likely to appeal to a younger, tech-savvy audience seeking a feature-rich, performance-oriented compact SUV. The vehicle's modern styling, advanced safety features, and connected car technology are likely to resonate with this demographic. Families looking for a safe and comfortable vehicle for city driving and occasional highway trips may also find the XUV 3XO appealing. The availability of both petrol and diesel engines makes it a suitable option for buyers with varying fuel preferences and usage patterns.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO competes in the highly competitive compact SUV segment, rivaling models such as the Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, and Nissan Magnite. To differentiate itself, the XUV 3XO emphasizes its powerful engine, advanced safety features (ADAS Level 2), premium interior, and connected car technology. \n\n* Compared to Tata Nexon: The XUV 3XO offers a more powerful engine and potentially more advanced ADAS features (depending on Nexon variant). The Nexon counters with strong sales figures and a loyal fanbase.\n* Compared to Maruti Suzuki Brezza: The XUV 3XO might offer a more feature-rich experience at a potentially lower price point. The Brezza relies on Maruti's established brand reputation and extensive service network.\n* Compared to Hyundai Venue & Kia Sonet: The XUV 3XO aims to match the Venue and Sonet in terms of features and technology, while potentially offering better performance.\n* Compared to Nissan Magnite: The XUV 3XO will likely be positioned as a more premium and feature-rich offering compared to the Magnite.\n\n**Key Selling Points:**\n\n*   **Powerful Engine:** The 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine is a major draw, offering best-in-class performance.\n*   **Advanced Safety Features:** Level 2 ADAS sets the XUV 3XO apart from many of its competitors.\n*   **Premium Interior:** The soft-touch materials and panoramic sunroof create a more upscale cabin experience.\n*   **Connected Car Technology:** The extensive connected car features offer convenience and control.\n*   **Value for Money:** The XUV 3XO offers a compelling value proposition, providing a lot of features at a competitive price.\n\n**Potential Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Ride Quality:** Improving the ride quality, especially on uneven road surfaces, would enhance the overall driving experience.\n*   **Long-Term Reliability:** Mahindra needs to ensure the long-term reliability of the XUV 3XO to build trust and confidence among buyers.\n*   **After-Sales Service:** Strengthening the after-sales service network and improving customer satisfaction would further enhance the brand's image.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Focus on Ride Quality:** Mahindra should prioritize improving the ride quality of the XUV 3XO to enhance its appeal to a wider range of buyers.\n*   **Strengthen Reliability:** Efforts should be made to ensure the long-term reliability of the vehicle, addressing any potential issues proactively.\n*   **Enhance Customer Service:** Improving after-sales service and customer satisfaction would build brand loyalty and positive word-of-mouth.\n\n**Risks or Warnings:**\n\n*   **Market Competition:** The compact SUV segment is highly competitive, and Mahindra needs to continuously innovate and improve its offerings to stay ahead.\n*   **Economic Conditions:** Fluctuations in economic conditions could impact demand for automobiles, including the XUV 3XO.\n*   **Changing Consumer Preferences:** Mahindra needs to stay abreast of changing consumer preferences and adapt its products accordingly.\n\n**Key Factors Considered:**\n\n*   Engine Performance\n*   Safety Features (ADAS)\n*   Interior Quality and Features\n*   Connected Car Technology\n*   Ride Quality\n*   Value for Money\n*   Brand Reputation\n\nIn conclusion, the Mahindra XUV 3XO is a promising compact SUV with a lot to offer. Its powerful engine, advanced safety features, premium interior, and connected car technology make it a compelling option in the market. However, Mahindra needs to address the potential areas for improvement, such as ride quality and long-term reliability, to fully realize the XUV 3XO's potential and solidify its position in the competitive compact SUV segment.",

            "summary": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO boasts a 5-star Bharat NCAP rating, with standard safety features including six airbags, ESC, and ABS. Higher variants offer Level 2 ADAS. While generally safe, frontal impact tests showed marginal protection for the driver's chest, legs, and feet.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO has garnered significant attention for its safety features, underlined by its 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP crash tests. This rating applies to both adult and child occupant protection, positioning the XUV 3XO as a benchmark in its segment. The SUV's safety suite is comprehensive, encompassing both passive and active safety systems designed to mitigate risks in various driving conditions.\n\n**Crash Test Performance**\n\nThe XUV 3XO achieved a notable score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. While the frontal offset deformable barrier test indicated excellent protection for the co-driver across all body regions, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings ranging from adequate to marginal. This suggests that while the vehicle structure is robust overall, specific areas of driver protection could be enhanced. Conversely, the XUV 3XO excelled in side barrier and pole impact tests, securing a perfect score of 16 out of 16 points. This demonstrates the SUV's ability to provide comprehensive protection to front-seat occupants in side-impact scenarios, safeguarding the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n\nIn terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO scored 43 out of 49. The SUV demonstrated excellent compatibility with child restraint systems (CRS), ensuring full protection for child passengers. This high score underscores Mahindra's commitment to prioritizing the safety of all occupants, including the most vulnerable.\n\n**Standard Safety Features**\n\nThe XUV 3XO comes equipped with a comprehensive array of standard safety features across all variants. Six airbags are standard, providing crucial protection in the event of a collision. Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) enhance the vehicle's stability and control, particularly in adverse driving conditions. Seat belt reminders for all seating positions further promote safety by encouraging seat belt usage among all occupants.\n\n**Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**\n\nFor customers opting for higher-end variants, the XUV 3XO offers Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). This suite includes features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking. Adaptive cruise control helps maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, reducing the risk of collisions in highway driving. Lane-keeping assist actively intervenes to keep the vehicle within its lane, preventing unintentional lane departures. Autonomous emergency braking can automatically apply the brakes to mitigate or avoid collisions, particularly in urban environments.\n\n**Comparison with Competing Models**\n\nWhen comparing the XUV 3XO's safety features with those of competing models, it is essential to consider both standard and optional equipment. Many competitors also offer six airbags and ESC as standard features. However, the availability of Level 2 ADAS in higher variants is a distinguishing factor for the XUV 3XO, providing a competitive edge in terms of advanced safety technology. Models like the Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza, and Hyundai Venue also offer strong safety features, but their crash test ratings and ADAS availability may vary.\n\n**Areas for Improvement**\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO performs admirably in crash tests, there are areas where safety features could be improved. The marginal ratings for the driver's chest, legs, and feet in frontal impact tests suggest a need for enhanced protection in these areas. This could involve modifications to the vehicle structure, improved airbag design, or enhancements to the seatbelt system. Further refinement of the ADAS system could also improve its effectiveness in real-world driving scenarios. For example, incorporating more advanced sensors and algorithms could enhance the system's ability to detect and respond to potential hazards.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo further enhance the safety of the XUV 3XO, Mahindra should consider the following recommendations:\n\n1.  **Improve Driver Protection in Frontal Impacts:** Focus on enhancing protection for the driver's chest, legs, and feet in frontal impact tests. This could involve structural reinforcements, advanced airbag technology, and improved seatbelt systems.\n2.  **Refine ADAS System:** Continuously improve the ADAS system's performance and reliability by incorporating more advanced sensors and algorithms. This could enhance its ability to detect and respond to potential hazards.\n3.  **Standardize ADAS Features:** Consider making some ADAS features standard across all variants to improve overall safety for all customers. This would ensure that even budget-conscious buyers benefit from advanced safety technology.\n4.  **Promote Safety Awareness:** Launch campaigns to educate customers about the importance of safety features and proper seatbelt usage. This can help maximize the effectiveness of the XUV 3XO's safety systems.\n\n**Risks and Warnings**\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO offers a high level of safety, it is important to recognize that no vehicle can guarantee complete protection in all crash scenarios. The vehicle's safety features are designed to mitigate risks and reduce the severity of injuries, but they are not a substitute for safe driving practices. Drivers should always adhere to traffic laws, maintain a safe following distance, and avoid distractions while driving.\n\n**Key Factors Considered**\n\nIn this analysis, the following key factors were considered:\n\n*   Bharat NCAP crash test ratings\n*   Adult and child occupant protection scores\n*   Standard safety features (airbags, ESC, ABS)\n*   Availability of Level 2 ADAS\n*   Comparison with competing models\n*   Areas for potential improvement\n*   Recommendations for further safety enhancements",

The infotainment is now a 10.25-inch unit and works well. By Nikhil Bhatia Share - Make : Mahindra Model : XUV 3XO We Like Upmarket interior Strong engines Long equipment list We Don't Like Boot space Competent as the Mahindra XUV300 was, it never quite made it to the list of compact SUV bestsellers. Mahindra is now gunning for glory with the updated XUV300, christened the XUV 3XO. Mind you, this is no run-of-the-mill nip and tuck update. Mahindra has gone all out with a new look, redone interior, some class-first feature introductions, some class-best specifications and very enticing pricing. The aim is to take the fight to the Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, and win. Mahindra XUV 3XO: design and styling Where the XUV300s styling was understated, the XUV 3XO is big on flash. Giving the 3XO its distinctive face are the large, new vertically oriented headlights outlined by C-shaped DRLs (a link to the larger XUV700). The headlights are split into two sections with a concealed projector unit up top, and an open projector fog lamp unit lower down, both set amidst a black surround. The lights flank the new grille, which is actually a gloss panel that runs much of the XUVs width. The new front bumper with its pronounced cuts and creases is very concept car-like and the newly contoured bonnet also does its bit to add volume to the design. New C-shaped LED DRLs provide a visual link with the larger XUV700. Like the XUV300, the 3XO looks muscular in profile, and furthering the impression are the stylish new 17-inch diamond cut alloy wheels that are the largest in the segment. Theres also chunkier side cladding with cuts at the wheel arches. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300s figure of 180mm.

The 2,600mm wheelbase remains class best, but the short overhangs, particularly at the back, tell you that this is a vehicle that's brutally shortened (remember it started life as a SsangYong Tivoli) to get length under the critical 4m mark, needed to qualify as a small car and hence a lower rate of tax. New 17-inch alloys are the largest in the segment.

The Mahindra XUV 3XO might be the car youre searching for! Lets dive into a detailed review to see what this model brings in 2025. Design and Exterior Highlights One look at the Mahindra XUV 3XO, especially in black, and its clear that this car is a head-turner. Its sporty design elements stand out with: Chrome Accents: The grille and headlamp finish feature stylish chrome highlights. Projector Headlamps with LED DRLs: These enhance visibility and aesthetics. Diamond-Cut Alloy Wheels: The 16-inch alloys add a premium feel to the vehicle. Safety Ratings: With six airbags and a five-star Global NCAP safety rating, this vehicle excels in safety. Roof Rails & Spoilers: Gloss-black roof rails and a sleek spoiler give it a bold presence on the road. Although the car lacks front parking sensors and certain accessories come as add-ons, its robust styling and road presence more than makes up for these minor drawbacks. Interior Comfort and Technology Step inside the Mahindra XUV 3XO, and youll be greeted by a modern and comfortable cabin: Dual-Tone Dashboard: Soft-touch materials on the doors and satin finishes on the levers add a premium touch. Advanced Infotainment System: A 10.25-inch infotainment display paired with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster ensures seamless access to information and entertainment. Steering Controls: A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel includes controls for cruise and infotainment systems. Comfort Features: From automatic climate control with dual-zone functionality to wireless charging and a vanity mirror with illumination, convenience is a priority. While its disappointing that the glovebox isnt cooled or illuminated, the XUV 3XO compensates with thoughtful features like rear AC vents, adjustable headrests, and ample storage options. Performance and Engine Specifications Under the hood, the Mahindra XUV 3XO packs a punch with its turbocharged petrol engine: Engine Options: It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder MPFI engine, delivering 109 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. Transmission: Choose between manual and automatic transmissions, depending on your driving preference. Fuel Efficiency: Mahindra claims an ARAI-certified mileage of 18.5 km/l, though real-world figures hover around 14-15 km/l. The cars ride quality, stability, and safety features like ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, and tyre pressure monitoring ensure a secure driving experience. Practicality and Storage With a 364-liter boot space, the XUV 3XO offers decent storage capacity. However, operating the boot can feel a bit cumbersome due to its electromagnetic button placement. The spare wheel, tool kit, and first-aid essentials are neatly arranged but require some effort to access. Final Thoughts The Mahindra XUV 3XO is an impressive contender in the compact SUV segment. While it has its minor quirks, the blend of safety, design, and performance makes it a strong value-for-money option in its price range. Would we recommend it? Absolutely! Add it to your shortlist and take it for a spin to see if its the perfect fit for your needs. Dont forget to share your thoughts on this versatile vehicle in the comments section!

This latest recognition comes on the heels of Bharat NCAP's recent safety assessments of other prominent SUVs, including Tata models and the Citroen Basalt, as well as Mahindras own Thar Roxx and XUV 400 EV, both of which also earned 5-star ratings. The XUV 3XO demonstrated strong safety performance in multiple areas of testing. It achieved a remarkable total score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. In the frontal offset deformable barrier test, the SUV exhibited excellent protection for the co-driver, with good ratings across all body regions. However, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings of adequate to marginal due to the impact forces recorded during the collision. Despite these minor deductions, protection to the driver's head, hip, and thigh was rated as good, reinforcing the XUV 3XOs overall structural integrity and crashworthiness. The XUV 3XO excelled in the side barrier and pole impact tests, securing a full 16 out of 16 points . These tests assess the SUVs ability to protect front-seat occupants in scenarios where side impacts pose a significant threat. Mahindras engineering expertise was evident, as the SUV delivered comprehensive protection to the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showcasing its robust design and stringent safety standards. In terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO also performed admirably, earning a total score of 43 out of 49 . While the SUV dropped a few points in the vehicle assessment score, it still received full marks in both the dynamic crash test and the child restraint system (CRS) parameters. The test evaluated the ability of child restraint systems to effectively secure young passengers during high-impact situations. The XUV 3XO accommodated CRS installations with ease, ensuring full protection for child passengers. Bharat NCAP tested both the fully loaded AX7 L variant and the entry-level MX2 variant of the XUV 3XO. The safety ratings are applicable across all variants, reflecting Mahindras commitment to offering consistent safety standards, regardless of trim level. The XUV 3XOs impressive safety performance is backed by a comprehensive suite of standard safety features. The SUV comes equipped with six airbags as a standard offering across all trims, ensuring superior protection for all occupants. Additionally, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) are standard, enhancing the vehicles stability and control in various driving conditions. Seat belt reminders are also provided for all seating positions, encouraging passengers to use seat belts at all times and thereby boosting overall safety. For customers opting for the higher-end variants, Mahindra offers Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) . This package includes features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking, adding another layer of safety and convenience for drivers. These technologies are designed to mitigate the risk of collisions and assist drivers in maintaining optimal control over the vehicle. The XUV 3XOs success in the Bharat NCAP crash tests is a testament to Mahindras dedication to vehicle safety.

The XUV3XO is the facelift version of the XUV300. Note that the latter has already received a full 5-star rating at the Global NCAP back in 2020. That is what we will base our post on. XUV3XO belongs to one of the most popular market segments in the country. There are tons of compact SUVs in this space including the likes of the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza and more. Therefore, it is not easy to dominate the competition. As a result, Mahindra offers some of the best-in-segment features to woo the customers. Its safety, striking looks and multiple powertrain options are its strengths. For now, let us take a look at the details of this case. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating In 2020, the Mahindra XUV300 scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in Child Occupant Protection (COP). Mahindra has always focused on ensuring that its vehicles possess the latest safety equipment. In fact, it was the first SUV in its class to offer 7 airbags. Later, one airbag was removed to control costs. This XUV300 featured ISOFIX child seat mounts, 4-channel ABS, Seatbelt Reminder, Front Seatbelt Pretensioners and dual-airbags (since the base model is tested). Therefore, even the base model was well-kitted when it comes to safety amenities. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Adult Safety In the AOP category, the XUV3XO secured an almost perfect 16.42 points out of a possible 17. In the crash test, the drivers head displayed good protection, while his chest showed adequate protection. Furthermore, the drivers knees demonstrated good protection and his tibias offered adequate and good protection. Finally, the drivers feet had adequate protection. On the other hand, the passengers head and neck experienced good protection along with the chest. Moreover, the passengers knees and tibias were able to get good protection as well. The bodyshell of the SUV was rated as stable and it was capable of withstanding further loadings. Also, the footwell area was rated as stable. For the Side Impact Regulation UN95, the car met the technical requirements as standard. All these factors contributed to the 5-star safety rating for adult protection. Mahindra XUV3XO Safety Rating Child Safety For the COP section, the child seats were installed for an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old occupant. For the latter, the seat was installed forward-facing with ISOFIX and top tether. It was able to prevent excessive forward movement during the impact. As a result, fair protection was available for the chest. For the younger child, the CRS (Child Restraint System) was installed with ISOFIX and support leg. In this configuration, the protection was good. Furthermore, the recommended CRSs did not show incompatibility. This model didnt offer 3-point seatbelts in all seating positions. The ISOFIX and top tether anchorages were standard in 2 outboard rear seats. Also, the SUV offers the passenger airbag disconnection switch in case a rearward-facing CRS needs to be installed in the front passenger seat. All these aspects ensured a decent 4-star safety rating. At the time, it bagged the highest combined points for any vehicle in India. That is a testament to the fact that it was ahead of the competition since the beginning. Also Read: What is Maruti WagonR Safety Rating by Global NCAP?

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO emerges as a compelling contender in the competitive compact SUV segment. This analysis delves into the vehicle's features, strengths, weaknesses, target audience, and competitive landscape, based on the provided data. \n\n**Overall Features Overview:**\n\nThe XUV 3XO presents a well-rounded package with a strong emphasis on performance, safety, and modern features. The availability of both petrol and diesel engine options, coupled with manual and automatic transmission choices, broadens its appeal to a diverse range of buyers. Key highlights include:\n\n*   **Powerful Engine Options:** The 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine, producing 130PS/230Nm, positions the XUV 3XO as one of the most powerful in its class. The 1.5L diesel engine offers a good blend of performance and fuel efficiency.\n*   **Advanced Safety Features:** The inclusion of Level 2 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) is a significant advantage, offering features such as forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control, enhancing safety and driver convenience.\n*   **Premium Interior and Features:** The soft-touch materials on the dashboard and door pads, along with the panoramic sunroof (claimed to be the largest in the segment), contribute to a more upscale and enjoyable cabin experience.\n*   **Connected Car Technology:** With over 60 connected car features, the XUV 3XO offers a modern and tech-savvy experience, allowing users to stay connected and in control of their vehicle.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Performance:** The powerful turbo-petrol engine provides excellent performance and drivability, making it a fun-to-drive option in the segment.\n*   **Safety:** The inclusion of Level 2 ADAS features significantly enhances the safety quotient of the vehicle.\n*   **Features:** The XUV 3XO is packed with features, including a panoramic sunroof, soft-touch materials, connected car technology, and a large touchscreen infotainment system, offering a premium experience.\n*   **Value Proposition:** The XUV 3XO offers a compelling value proposition, providing a lot of features and performance at a competitive price point.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Ride Quality:** While the feature list is extensive, some reviews indicate that ride quality can be improved, especially on uneven road surfaces.\n*   **Long-Term Reliability:** As a relatively new model, the long-term reliability of the XUV 3XO is yet to be established. Potential buyers should consider this factor.\n*   **Brand Perception:** While Mahindra has made significant strides in recent years, it still lags behind some established players in terms of brand perception and customer service.\n*   **Subjective Luxury:** The term luxury is subjective, and while the XUV 3XO offers premium features, it may not meet the expectations of buyers seeking a truly luxurious experience.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe Mahindra XUV 3XO is likely to appeal to a younger, tech-savvy audience seeking a feature-rich, performance-oriented compact SUV.

This rating applies to both adult and child occupant protection, positioning the XUV 3XO as a benchmark in its segment. The SUV's safety suite is comprehensive, encompassing both passive and active safety systems designed to mitigate risks in various driving conditions.\n\n**Crash Test Performance**\n\nThe XUV 3XO achieved a notable score of 29.36 out of 32 for adult occupant protection. While the frontal offset deformable barrier test indicated excellent protection for the co-driver across all body regions, the driver's chest, legs, and feet received ratings ranging from adequate to marginal. This suggests that while the vehicle structure is robust overall, specific areas of driver protection could be enhanced. Conversely, the XUV 3XO excelled in side barrier and pole impact tests, securing a perfect score of 16 out of 16 points. This demonstrates the SUV's ability to provide comprehensive protection to front-seat occupants in side-impact scenarios, safeguarding the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n\nIn terms of child occupant safety, the XUV 3XO scored 43 out of 49. The SUV demonstrated excellent compatibility with child restraint systems (CRS), ensuring full protection for child passengers. This high score underscores Mahindra's commitment to prioritizing the safety of all occupants, including the most vulnerable.\n\n**Standard Safety Features**\n\nThe XUV 3XO comes equipped with a comprehensive array of standard safety features across all variants. Six airbags are standard, providing crucial protection in the event of a collision. Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) enhance the vehicle's stability and control, particularly in adverse driving conditions. Seat belt reminders for all seating positions further promote safety by encouraging seat belt usage among all occupants.\n\n**Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**\n\nFor customers opting for higher-end variants, the XUV 3XO offers Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). This suite includes features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking. Adaptive cruise control helps maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, reducing the risk of collisions in highway driving. Lane-keeping assist actively intervenes to keep the vehicle within its lane, preventing unintentional lane departures. Autonomous emergency braking can automatically apply the brakes to mitigate or avoid collisions, particularly in urban environments.\n\n**Comparison with Competing Models**\n\nWhen comparing the XUV 3XO's safety features with those of competing models, it is essential to consider both standard and optional equipment. Many competitors also offer six airbags and ESC as standard features. However, the availability of Level 2 ADAS in higher variants is a distinguishing factor for the XUV 3XO, providing a competitive edge in terms of advanced safety technology. Models like the Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza, and Hyundai Venue also offer strong safety features, but their crash test ratings and ADAS availability may vary.\n\n**Areas for Improvement**\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO performs admirably in crash tests, there are areas where safety features could be improved. The marginal ratings for the driver's chest, legs, and feet in frontal impact tests suggest a need for enhanced protection in these areas. This could involve modifications to the vehicle structure, improved airbag design, or enhancements to the seatbelt system. Further refinement of the ADAS system could also improve its effectiveness in real-world driving scenarios. For example, incorporating more advanced sensors and algorithms could enhance the system's ability to detect and respond to potential hazards.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo further enhance the safety of the XUV 3XO, Mahindra should consider the following recommendations:\n\n1.  **Improve Driver Protection in Frontal Impacts:** Focus on enhancing protection for the driver's chest, legs, and feet in frontal impact tests. This could involve structural reinforcements, advanced airbag technology, and improved seatbelt systems.\n2.  **Refine ADAS System:** Continuously improve the ADAS system's performance and reliability by incorporating more advanced sensors and algorithms. This could enhance its ability to detect and respond to potential hazards.\n3.  **Standardize ADAS Features:** Consider making some ADAS features standard across all variants to improve overall safety for all customers. This would ensure that even budget-conscious buyers benefit from advanced safety technology.\n4.  **Promote Safety Awareness:** Launch campaigns to educate customers about the importance of safety features and proper seatbelt usage. This can help maximize the effectiveness of the XUV 3XO's safety systems.\n\n**Risks and Warnings**\n\nWhile the XUV 3XO offers a high level of safety, it is important to recognize that no vehicle can guarantee complete protection in all crash scenarios. The vehicle's safety features are designed to mitigate risks and reduce the severity of injuries, but they are not a substitute for safe driving practices. Drivers should always adhere to traffic laws, maintain a safe following distance, and avoid distractions while driving.\n\n**Key Factors Considered**\n\nIn this analysis, the following key factors were considered:\n\n*   Bharat NCAP crash test ratings\n*   Adult and child occupant protection scores\n*   Standard safety features (airbags, ESC, ABS)\n*   Availability of Level 2 ADAS\n*   Comparison with competing models\n*   Areas for potential improvement\n*   Recommendations for further safety enhancements",
