By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars', 'content': \"Trends in electric cars Global EV Outlook 2024 Analysis - IEA IEA Close Search Search About News Events Programmes Help centre IEA Skip navigation Search Energy system Chevron down Explore the energy system by fuel, technology or sector Fossil Fuels Renewables Electricity Low-Emissions Fuels Transport Industry Buildings Energy Efficiency and Demand Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Decarbonisation Enablers Buildings Energy Efficiency and Demand Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Decarbonisation Enablers Explore all Topics Chevron down Understand the biggest energy challenges Energy Security Artificial Intelligence Critical Minerals Access and Affordability Energy Innovation Investment Climate Change COP28: Tracking the Energy Outcomes Net Zero Emissions Russia's War on Ukraine Climate Change COP28: Tracking the Energy Outcomes Net Zero Emissions Russia's War on Ukraine Energy and Gender Energy and Water Fossil Fuel Subsidies Saving Energy Global Energy Crisis The IEA's 50th Anniversary All topics Countries Chevron down Explore the energy system by country or region Member countries Australia Austria Belgium Canada Czechia Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Ireland Italy Japan Korea Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Mexico New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Slovak Republic Spain Sweden Switzerland The Netherlands Trkiye United Kingdom United States Accession countries Chile Colombia Costa Rica Israel Association countries Argentina Brazil China Egypt India Indonesia Kenya Morocco Senegal Singapore South Africa Thailand Ukraine All Countries and Regions Data Chevron down Use, download and buy global energy data Data explorers Understand and manipulate data with easy to use explorers and trackers Data explorers Data sets Free and paid data sets from across the energy system available for download Data sets Policies database Past, existing or planned government policies and measures Policies database Chart Library Access every chart published across all IEA reports and analysis Chart Explore data Reports Chevron down Read the latest analysis from the IEA Oil Market Report - July 2025 Fuel report  July 2025 Energy and AI Flagship report  April 2025 Energy Technology Perspectives 2024 Flagship report  October 2024 World Energy Outlook 2024 Flagship report  October 2024 All reports Search Bag 1 User Profile Search Sign In Flyout close You are connecting via IP recognition from .

By: Hannah Ritchie First published in February 2024. Last updated in May 2025. Cite this article Reuse our work freely Electric vehicles are an essential solution to decarbonizing transport. Electric cars tend to have a lower carbon footprint than petrol or diesel cars over their lifetimes. While more carbon is emitted in the manufacturing stage, this carbon debt tends to pay off quickly once theyre on the road. 1 The carbon savings are higher in countries with a cleaner electricity mix , and these savings will also increase as countries continue to decarbonize their electricity grids. How quickly are countries moving to electrified transport? Which countries are leading the way? In this article, we look at data from across the world on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock on the road. This data comes from the International Energy Agency . It publishes its Global EV Outlook every year. We will update this data every time a new release is published. 2 Sales of new cars What share of new cars are electric? Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets. Globally, over 1-in-5 (22%) of new cars sold were electric in 2024. This share was 92% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 50%. In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world. Here, electric cars include fully battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . Fully-electric cars vs. plug-in hybrids Electric cars include battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The difference is that fully battery-electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. In contrast, plug-in hybrids have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline. That means a plug-in hybrid could be driven as a standard petrol car if the owner did not charge the battery. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out. Since plug-in hybrids will often run on petrol, they tend to emit more carbon than battery-electric cars. However, they do usually have lower emissions than petrol or diesel cars. 3 In the first chart below you can see electric car sales broken down by these two technologies. This is given as a share of new cars sold each year. In the second, you will find the share of new electric cars sold that are fully battery-electric . How many new electric cars are sold each year? The chart below shows the total number of new electric cars sold. Again, this includes fully battery-electric and plug-in hybrids . Clicking on any country will show how sales have changed over time. How many new internal combustion engine cars and electric cars are sold each year? Based on the data published by the IEA on the number of electric cars sold, and EV sales as a share of all new cars, we can calculate the absolute number of new cars of each type sold each year. These figures suggest that global sales of non-electric cars peaked in 2018. This aligns with other estimates published elsewhere; for example, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that sales peaked in 2017. You can explore this data for other countries in the chart below, too. Stocks of cars in use What share of cars on the road are electric? The cars that are on the road today represent sales data over more than a decade. This can be captured in a metric called stocks. Its an approximation of the number of cars that are in use and represents the balance of cars being added and those that are being retired. Because people use their cars for a long time, it takes time before new sales have a visible influence on car stocks. That means the share', 'images': [], 'rank': 1}, {'url': 'https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars', 'content': \"Trends in electric cars Global EV Outlook 2024 Analysis - IEA IEA Close Search Search About News Events Programmes Help centre IEA Skip navigation Search Energy system Chevron down Explore the energy system by fuel, technology or sector Fossil Fuels Renewables Electricity Low-Emissions Fuels Transport Industry Buildings Energy Efficiency and Demand Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Decarbonisation Enablers Buildings Energy Efficiency and Demand Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Decarbonisation Enablers Explore all Topics Chevron down Understand the biggest energy challenges Energy Security Artificial Intelligence Critical Minerals Access and Affordability Energy Innovation Investment Climate Change COP28: Tracking the Energy Outcomes Net Zero Emissions Russia's War on Ukraine Climate Change COP28: Tracking the Energy Outcomes Net Zero Emissions Russia's War on Ukraine Energy and Gender Energy and Water Fossil Fuel Subsidies Saving Energy Global Energy Crisis The IEA's 50th Anniversary All topics Countries Chevron down Explore the energy system by country or region Member countries Australia Austria Belgium Canada Czechia Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Ireland Italy Japan Korea Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Mexico New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Slovak Republic Spain Sweden Switzerland The Netherlands Trkiye United Kingdom United States Accession countries Chile Colombia Costa Rica Israel Association countries Argentina Brazil China Egypt India Indonesia Kenya Morocco Senegal Singapore South Africa Thailand Ukraine All Countries and Regions Data Chevron down Use, download and buy global energy data Data explorers Understand and manipulate data with easy to use explorers and trackers Data explorers Data sets Free and paid data sets from across the energy system available for download Data sets Policies database Past, existing or planned government policies and measures Policies database Chart Library Access every chart published across all IEA reports and analysis Chart Explore data Reports Chevron down Read the latest analysis from the IEA Oil Market Report - July 2025 Fuel report  July 2025 Energy and AI Flagship report  April 2025 Energy Technology Perspectives 2024 Flagship report  October 2024 World Energy Outlook 2024 Flagship report  October 2024 All reports Search Bag 1 User Profile Search Sign In Flyout close You are connecting via IP recognition from .
